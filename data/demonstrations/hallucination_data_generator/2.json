    "text": "Input:\nDirections:\nFollow the instructions\n\nReference Document:\nThe transcriptional coactivator the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) has been identified as an important mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis based on its ability to interact with transcription factors that activate nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. The induction of PGC-1alpha protein expression under conditions that provoke mitochondrial biogenesis, such as contractile activity or thyroid hormone (T(3)) treatment, is not fully characterized. Thus we related PGC-1alpha protein expression to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in 1) tissues of varying oxidative capacities, 2) tissues from animals treated with T(3), and 3) skeletal muscle subject to contractile activity both in cell culture and in vivo. Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation (r = 0.74; P < 0.05) between changes in PGC-1alpha and COX activity, used as an index of mitochondrial adaptations. The highest constitutive levels of PGC-1alpha were found in the heart, whereas the lowest were measured in fast-twitch white muscle and liver. T(3) increased PGC-1alpha content similarly in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle, as well as in the liver, but not in heart. T(3) also induced early (6 h) increases in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKalpha) activity, as well as later (5 day) increases in p38 MAP kinase activity in slow-twitch, but not in fast-twitch, muscle. Contractile activity provoked early increases in PGC-1alpha, coincident with increases in mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) protein expression, suggesting that PGC-1alpha is physiologically important in coordinating the expression of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Ca(2+) ionophore treatment of muscle cells led to an approximately threefold increase in PGC-1alpha protein, and contractile activity induced rapid and marked increases in both p38 MAP kinase and AMPKalpha activities. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) treatment of muscle cells also led to parallel increases in AMPKalpha activity and PGC-1alpha protein levels. These data are consistent with observations that indicate that increases in PGC-1alpha protein are affected by Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms, AMPKalpha activity, as well as posttranslational phosphorylation events that increase PGC-1alpha protein stability. Our data support a role for PGC-1alpha in the physiological regulation of mitochondrial content in a variety of tissues and suggest that increases in PGC-1alpha expression form part of a unifying pathway that promotes both T(3)- and contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations.\n- Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle impacting metabolic rate, contractility and structural hypertrophy. Using an in vivo model of chronic treatment with thyroid hormone (T4, 0.3 mg/kg/day), we evaluated how mitochondria are regulated in response to T4, and assessed the relationship of T4-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics to overall cardiac hypertrophy. The role of thyroid hormone in cardiac bioenergetic remodeling was addressed in rats treated with T4 for 5, 10 and 15 days. Over that time, myocardial oxygen consumption substantially increased as did cardiac hypertrophy. Myocardial levels of mitochondrial enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), specific proteins and transcript were assessed. Activity levels of respiratory complexes I-V and citrate synthase significantly increased with 15 but not with 5 or 10-day T4 treatment. Myocardial levels of mtDNA, mitochondrial proteins (e.g. cytochrome c, cytochrome b, ATPase subunits, MnSOD) and the global transcription factor PPARalpha were significantly elevated with 15-day T4. Transcript analysis revealed increased expression of transcription factors and cofactors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis including PPARalpha, mtTFA, ErbAalpha and PGC-1alpha. Our findings indicate parallel increases in myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis with 15-day T4; these changes were not present with 10-day T4 even with significant cardiac hypertrophy. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.\n- Thyroid hormone (TH) induces marked changes in the biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle affecting its bioenergetics, contractility and structure. Using a time-course analysis of in vitro treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with triiodothyronine (T3), mitochondrial biogenesis, functional bioenergetics and cardiomyocyte hypertrophic phenotype were assessed. Activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha), were significantly elevated with 72 h T3 treatment. A time-course analysis showed an early increase (between 3 and 12 h) in activity and levels of subunits of complex IV and V, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and a late increase (at 72 h) in complex II and CS activities, mitochondrial protein content and mitochondrial respiration. Based on overall protein content and specific peptide levels (e.g. actin or myosin) only mild cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was detected. T3 mediates an early stimulation of enzymes containing mtDNA encoded subunits (e.g. complex IV and V) in contrast to a different regulatory pattern for the entirely nuclear-encoded enzymes (e.g. CS and complex II). T3-regulation was similar in both neonatal and young adult cardiomyocytes (ARCM) but absent in the senescent cardiomyocytes. This model offer an opportunity to study the rapid timing of events involved in myocardial cell signaling, bioenergetics and growth dynamics in a timeframe not available with whole animal studies.\n- Hypothyroidism during early mammalian brain development is associated with decreased expression of various mitochondrial encoded genes along with evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction. However, in-spite of the similarities between neurological disorders caused by perinatal hypothyroidism and those caused by various genetic mitochondrial defects we still do not know as to how thyroid hormone (TH) regulates mitochondrial transcription during development and whether this regulation by TH is nuclear mediated or through mitochondrial TH receptors? We here in rat cerebellum show that hypothyroidism causes reduction in expression of nuclear encoded genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis like PGC-1alpha, NRF-1alpha and Tfam. Also, we for the first time demonstrate a mitochondrial localization of thyroid hormone receptor (mTR) isoform in developing brain capable of binding a TH response element (DR2) present in D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA. These results thus indicate an integrated nuclear-mitochondrial cross talk in regulation of mitochondrial transcription by TH during brain development.\n- In vertebrates, skeletal muscle myofibers display different contractile and metabolic properties associated with different mitochondrial content and activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) regulating mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. When overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it increases mitochondrial DNA content, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces a shift in the metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers toward a slower and more oxidative phenotype. Here we show that a p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle in association with the induction of a more glycolytic muscle phenotype and a decrease of capillary density. In addition, p43(-/-) mice displayed a significant increase in muscle mass relative to control animals and had an improved ability to use lipids. Our findings establish that the p43 mitochondrial receptor strongly affects muscle mass and the metabolic and contractile features of myofibers and provides evidence that this receptor mediates, in part, the influence of thyroid hormone in skeletal muscle.\n- Thyroid hormone is a major determinant of energy expenditure and a key regulator of mitochondrial activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) that acts as a mitochondrial transcription factor of the organelle genome, which leads, in vitro and in vivo, to a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we generated mice specifically lacking p43 to address its physiological influence. We found that p43 is required for normal glucose homeostasis. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, a high-fat/high-sucrose diet elicited more severe glucose intolerance than that recorded in normal animals. In addition, we observed in p43(-/-) mice both a decrease in pancreatic islet density and in the activity of complexes of the respiratory chain in isolated pancreatic islets. These dysfunctions were associated with a down-regulation of the expression of the glucose transporter Glut2 and of Kir6.2, a key component of the K(ATP) channel. Our findings establish that p43 is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and provide evidence for the first time of a physiological role for a mitochondrial endocrine receptor.\n- Mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations contribute to various disease states characterized by low ATP production. In contrast, thyroid hormone [3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T(3))] induces mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances ATP generation within cells. To evaluate the role of T(3)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with mtDNA mutations, three fibroblast cell lines with mtDNA mutations were evaluated, including two patients with Leigh's syndrome and one with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Compared with control cells, patient fibroblasts displayed similar levels of mitochondrial mass, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) protein expression. However, patient cells exhibited a 1.6-fold elevation in ROS production, a 1.7-fold elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, a 1.2-fold elevation in mitochondrial membrane potential, and 30% less complex V activity compared with control cells. Patient cells also displayed 20-25% reductions in both cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and MnSOD protein levels compared with control cells. After T(3) treatment of patient cells, ROS production was decreased by 40%, cytoplasmic Ca2+ was reduced by 20%, COX activity was increased by 1.3-fold, and ATP levels were elevated by 1.6-fold, despite the absence of a change in mitochondrial mass. There were no significant alterations in the protein expression of PGC-1alpha, Tfam, or UCP2 in either T(3)-treated patient or control cells. However, T(3) restored the mitochondrial membrane potential, complex V activity, and levels of MnSOD to normal values in patient cells and elevated MnSOD levels by 21% in control cells. These results suggest that T(3) acts to reduce cellular oxidative stress, which may help attenuate ROS-mediated damage, along with improving mitochondrial function and energy status in cells with mtDNA defects.\n- Thyroid hormone (T(3)) regulates the function of many tissues within the body. The effects of T(3) have largely been attributed to the modulation of thyroid hormone receptor-dependent gene transcription. However, nongenomic actions of T(3) via the initiation of signaling events are emerging in a number of cell types. This study investigated the ability of short-term T(3) treatment to phosphorylate and, therefore, activate signaling proteins in rat tissues in vivo. The kinases investigated included p38, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Following 2 h of T(3) treatment, p38 and AMPK phosphorylation was increased in both the slow-twitch soleus and the fast-twitch plantaris muscles. In contrast, ERK1/2 was not activated in either muscle type. Neither p38 nor AMPK was affected in heart. However, AMPK activation was decreased by T(3) in liver. ERK1/2 activation was decreased by T(3) in heart, but increased in liver. Possible downstream consequences of T(3)-induced kinase phosphorylation were investigated by measuring cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and thyroid hormone receptor DNA binding, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator-1 mRNA levels. Protein DNA binding to the cAMP or thyroid hormone response elements was unaltered by T(3). However, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator-1 mRNA expression was increased following 12 h of T(3) treatment in soleus. These data are the first to characterize the effects of T(3) treatment on kinase phosphorylation in vivo. We show that T(3) rapidly modifies kinase activity in a tissue-specific fashion. Moreover, the T(3)-induced phosphorylation of p38 and AMPK in both slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscles suggests that these events may be important in mediating hormone-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.\n- In previous studies, we characterized a new hormonal pathway involving a mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) acting as a mitochondrial transcription factor. In in vitro and in vivo studies, we have shown that p43 increases mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, p43 overexpression in skeletal muscle stimulates mitochondrial respiration and induces a shift in metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers which became more oxidative.Here we have studied the influence of p43 overexpression in skeletal muscle of mice during aging. We report that p43 overexpression initially increased mitochondrial mass. However, after the early rise in mitochondrial DNA occurring at 2 months of age in transgenic mice, we observed a progressive decrease of mitochondrial DNA content which became 2-fold lower at 23 months of age relatively to control animals. Moreover, p43 overexpression induced an oxidative stress characterized by a strong increase of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in quadriceps muscle, although antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were stimulated. In addition, muscle atrophy became detectable at 6 months of age, probably through a stimulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway via two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases E3, Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1.Taken together, these results demonstrate that a prolonged stimulation of mitochondrial activity induces muscle atrophy. In addition, these data underline the importance of a tight control of p43 expression and suggest that a deregulation of the direct T3 mitochondrial pathway could be one of the parameters involved in the occurrence of sarcopenia.\n- T3 and GH have been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Since thyroid hormone promotes the synthesis of growth hormone, its control of human mitochondrial biogenesis could arise through a permissive action on GH biosynthesis. This was studied in hypophysectomized rats treated with T3 and/or human GH by the continuous infusion of hormone for 6 days from mini-infusion pumps implanted sc. Increases in mitochondrial respiration, enzyme activities, and protein synthesis were found in isolated liver mitochondria from rats receiving T3. In contrast, GH alone had no effect, nor did it increase the response to T3. Since it has been argued that mitochondrial biogenesis results from a direct interaction (binding) of GH with mitochondria, GH-specific binding sites were measured with 125I-bGH, a specific somatogenic receptor ligand, in isolated mitochondrial membranes in vitro. In addition, the intracellular endocytic uptake of 125I-bGH injected in vivo was compared in purified subcellular membrane fractions and mitochondria. No evidence in favour of specific GH interaction on mitochondrial membranes was found by either test. It is concluded that T3 exerts a direct, rather than permissive, effect on mitochondrial biogenesis, and that high affinity binding sites for GH are not present in rat liver mitochondria.\n- In order to analyze the role of thyroid hormones in mitochondrial biogenesis, we have studied the expression pattern of the beta subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase complex in liver and in isolated mitochondria during postnatal development of hypothyroid rats. Chemically induced hypothyroidism promoted a significant reduction in body and liver masses at all stages of development. Furthermore, plasma 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4) concentrations were significantly reduced in hypothyroid animals when compared to euthyroid animals. Remarkably, steady-state beta-F1-ATPase mRNA levels in livers of hypothyroid animals showed an approximately 50% reduction when compared to age-matched euthyroid rats at all stages of development. The relative amounts of beta-F1-ATPase protein determined in isolated mitochondria of 1-day-old and adult hypothyroid animals were similar to those determined in mitochondria of age-matched euthyroids, indicating that hypothyroidism does not affect organelle differentiation in the liver of suckling and adult rats. In contrast, the relative amount of beta-F1-ATPase protein in liver homogenates varied (0-30% reduction) due to the hypothyroid condition during development. These findings suggest the existence of compensatory mechanisms operating at the translational and/or post-translational levels which promote proliferation of mitochondria in the hypothyroid liver. However, when the liver mass was considered, hypothyroidism significantly reduced overall mitochondrial proliferation in rat liver. Interestingly, the effects of thyroid hormones on the biogenesis of the ATP synthase complex at latter stages of development provide an example in which the hypothyroid condition limits the expression of the nuclear-encoded gene with no apparent effect on the expression of the mitochondrial-encoded genes (ATP synthase subunits 6-8).\n- Exogenous thyroid hormones are regulators of cellular metabolism that involves, along with other cell structures, mitochondria. Mechanisms of the influence of thyroid hormones on the biogenesis of mtDNA are not fully understood due to their pleiotropic nature. Different ways of regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by thyroid hormones are discussed in literature, but thyroid receptors, localized in both the nucleus and mitochondria, are the main elements of most pathways. Data on events occurring after receptor activation are rather contradictory. We investigated the degree of involvement of mitochondrial transcription factors in the biogenesis of mtDNA induced by triiodothyronine. The contribution of TFAM, TFB2M, and helicase Twinkle in thyroid-induced mtDNA biogenesis was assessed. The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis. The role of helicase Twinkle, the expression induction of which is also observed after triiodothyronine addition, remains unclear. The analysis of factors that activate TFAM and TFB2M expression showed that NRF-1 is the determinative regulator: deficiency of this factor leads to complete collapse of mtDNA biogenesis. However, lack of transcriptional coactivator PGC-1\u03b1 did not lead to significant reduction in thyroid-induced biogenesis, whereas literature data point to its key role in the biogenesis of mitochondria. Thus, in this study the role of key transcription factors in mtDNA biogenesis induced by triiodothyronine was demonstrated for the first time in a model system.\n- Thyroid hormone is one of the few known physiological regulators of mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis. Although it exerts a global effect on biogenesis, it does so by regulating the expression of a limited number of unidentified mitochondrial proteins. We have investigated these hormone-regulated proteins in rat liver. Hormone injection induced a 30-fold increase in the levels of cytochrome-c1 mRNA after 3 d. In addition, the mRNA for the growth-activated adenine-nucleotide translocator, ANT2, was increased 13-fold and that for the ATPase N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein increased 4-5-fold. Mitochondrial transcripts of cytochrome-oxidase subunit I also increased. No changes were found in the mRNA levels for the F1-ATPase beta-subunit or cytochrome oxidase IV. A single low dose of triiodothyronine induces rapid increases in cytochrome-c1 and ANT2 mRNA species which parallel changes in the activity of the hormone-responsive malic enzyme, but are earlier than other mitochondrial biogenetic events. These data strengthen the view that thyroid hormone regulates synthesis of specific components within each respiratory-chain complex and that these products apparently play key roles in inner-membrane biogenesis and assembly. The significance of ANT2 induction is also discussed with respect to the rapid respiratory response induced by thyroid hormone.\n- 3,5,3'-Levo-triiodothyronine (L-T3) is essential for DNA transcription, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, but its circulating levels rapidly decrease after myocardial infarction (MI). The main aim of our study was to test whether an early and sustained normalization of L-T3 serum levels after MI exerts myocardial protective effects through a mitochondrial preservation. Seventy-two hours after MI induced by anterior interventricular artery ligation, rats were infused with synthetic L-T3 (1.2 \u03bcg/kg/day) or saline over 4 weeks. Compared to saline, L-T3 infusion restored FT3 serum levels at euthyroid state (3.0 \u00b1 0.2 versus 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 pg/ml), improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (39.5 \u00b1 2.5 versus 65.5 \u00b1 6.9%), preserved LV end-systolic wall thickening in the peri-infarct zone (6.34 \u00b1 3.1 versus 33.7 \u00b1 6.21%) and reduced LV infarct-scar size by approximately 50% (all P < 0.05). Moreover, L-T3 significantly increased angiogenesis and cell survival and enhanced the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors involved in these processes. Finally, L-T3 significantly increased the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1\u03b1, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, in the LV peri-infarct zone. To further explore mechanisms of L-T3 protective effects, we exposed isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes to H(2)O(2) and found that L-T3 rescued mitochondrial biogenesis and function and protected against cell death via a mitoKATP dependent pathway. Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection.\n- The energy relationships between cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism were studied in the hearts from euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. Isolated mitochondria showed high respiratory control ratios and impermeability to exogenous NADH. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, resulted in lower and higher contents of both cytochromes per mitochondrion and mitochondrial protein per gram of wet weight of heart without changes in the ratio of cytochrome c to cytochrome aa3. In isolated perfused heart, the hyperthyroid state led to an increase in work rate and thereby an elevation of Vo2, which resulted in an increase oxidation-reduction turnover number for the cytochromes. An agreement was found between [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] of cytosolic free adenine nucleotides and the value calculated from a mathematical model of mitochondrial respiration. This implies that mitochondrial respiration is controlled at the cytochrome oxidase reaction and that oxidative phosphorylation in intact tissue is tightly coupled irrespective of thyroid state. It is concluded that thyroid hormone causes an increase in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial cytochrome content, and respiratory rate, and consequently expands the capacity of oxidative metabolism without an uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation.\n- Thyroid hormone [3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3))] induces phenotypic alterations in cardiac mitochondria, in part by influencing protein import and the expression of the import motor mitochondrial heat shock protein (mtHsp70). Here we examined the adaptability of translocases of the inner membrane (Tim) proteins, as well as the outer membrane receptor Tom34, to T(3). Administration of T(3) to rats for 5 days increased cardiac Tim23 and Tim44 mRNA levels by 55 and 50%, respectively, but had no effect on Tim17. T(3) treatment also induced a 45% increase in Tom34 mRNA, with no accompanying changes at the protein level, suggesting regulation at the posttranscriptional level. In H9c2 cardiac cells, Tim17 mRNA was elevated by 114% by 9 days of differentiation, whereas Tim23 and Tim44 declined by 25 and 29%, respectively. To determine the functional consequences of these T(3)-induced changes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) import rates were measured in H9c2 cells stably overexpressing Tim44 and mtHsp70, either alone or in combination. MDH import remained unaltered in cells overexpressing Tim44 or in cells overexpressing both Tim44 and mtHsp70. However, when mtHsp70 was overexpressed alone, a 13% (P < 0.05) increase in MDH import rate was observed. These findings indicate that import machinery components are differentially regulated in response to stimuli that induce mitochondrial biogenesis, like T(3) and differentiation. In addition, the induction of an import machinery component in response to T(3) may not necessarily result in functional changes in protein import during mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, mtHsp70 may play a regulatory role in the import process that is independent of its interaction with Tim44.\n\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\n\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\n\u2026\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\n\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\n\n\nQuestion:\nHow does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium?\n\nOutput:\nNon-Hallucinated Answer:\nThyroid hormone (TH), particularly triiodothyronine (T3), plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium through various mechanisms. The effects of T3 on mitochondrial biogenesis are mediated by its ability to influence the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors and mitochondrial proteins. For instance, T3 treatment has been shown to significantly increase the expression of key transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) (Reference Document).\n\nIn a study involving chronic T4 treatment in rats, it was observed that myocardial levels of mitochondrial enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) significantly increased after 15 days of treatment, indicating enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis (Reference Document). This increase was associated with elevated expression of transcription factors and cofactors, including PGC-1alpha, which is known to coordinate the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Additionally, T3 has been shown to induce early increases in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, which is linked to the activation of pathways that promote mitochondrial biogenesis (Reference Document).\n\nMoreover, T3 treatment has been demonstrated to enhance mitochondrial function and energy status, particularly in the context of oxidative stress. In fibroblast cell lines with mtDNA mutations, T3 treatment improved mitochondrial function and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suggesting that T3 not only promotes biogenesis but also protects against mitochondrial dysfunction (Reference Document). The regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by T3 is further supported by evidence showing that T3 can activate signaling pathways that lead to the phosphorylation of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, such as p38 MAP kinase and AMPK (Reference Document).\n\nOverall, thyroid hormone, through its genomic and non-genomic actions, regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium by enhancing the expression of critical transcription factors, promoting mitochondrial enzyme activity, and improving mitochondrial function, thereby contributing to the overall metabolic health of cardiac tissue.\n\nHallucinated Answer:\nThyroid hormone (TH), particularly triiodothyronine (T3), plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium through various mechanisms.

            "The transcriptional coactivator the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) has been identified as an important mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis based on its ability to interact with transcription factors that activate nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. The induction of PGC-1alpha protein expression under conditions that provoke mitochondrial biogenesis, such as contractile activity or thyroid hormone (T(3)) treatment, is not fully characterized. Thus we related PGC-1alpha protein expression to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in 1) tissues of varying oxidative capacities, 2) tissues from animals treated with T(3), and 3) skeletal muscle subject to contractile activity both in cell culture and in vivo. Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation (r = 0.74; P < 0.05) between changes in PGC-1alpha and COX activity, used as an index of mitochondrial adaptations. The highest constitutive levels of PGC-1alpha were found in the heart, whereas the lowest were measured in fast-twitch white muscle and liver. T(3) increased PGC-1alpha content similarly in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle, as well as in the liver, but not in heart. T(3) also induced early (6 h) increases in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKalpha) activity, as well as later (5 day) increases in p38 MAP kinase activity in slow-twitch, but not in fast-twitch, muscle. Contractile activity provoked early increases in PGC-1alpha, coincident with increases in mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) protein expression, suggesting that PGC-1alpha is physiologically important in coordinating the expression of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Ca(2+) ionophore treatment of muscle cells led to an approximately threefold increase in PGC-1alpha protein, and contractile activity induced rapid and marked increases in both p38 MAP kinase and AMPKalpha activities. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) treatment of muscle cells also led to parallel increases in AMPKalpha activity and PGC-1alpha protein levels. These data are consistent with observations that indicate that increases in PGC-1alpha protein are affected by Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms, AMPKalpha activity, as well as posttranslational phosphorylation events that increase PGC-1alpha protein stability. Our data support a role for PGC-1alpha in the physiological regulation of mitochondrial content in a variety of tissues and suggest that increases in PGC-1alpha expression form part of a unifying pathway that promotes both T(3)- and contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations.",
            "Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle impacting metabolic rate, contractility and structural hypertrophy. Using an in vivo model of chronic treatment with thyroid hormone (T4, 0.3 mg/kg/day), we evaluated how mitochondria are regulated in response to T4, and assessed the relationship of T4-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics to overall cardiac hypertrophy. The role of thyroid hormone in cardiac bioenergetic remodeling was addressed in rats treated with T4 for 5, 10 and 15 days. Over that time, myocardial oxygen consumption substantially increased as did cardiac hypertrophy. Myocardial levels of mitochondrial enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), specific proteins and transcript were assessed. Activity levels of respiratory complexes I-V and citrate synthase significantly increased with 15 but not with 5 or 10-day T4 treatment. Myocardial levels of mtDNA, mitochondrial proteins (e.g. cytochrome c, cytochrome b, ATPase subunits, MnSOD) and the global transcription factor PPARalpha were significantly elevated with 15-day T4. Transcript analysis revealed increased expression of transcription factors and cofactors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis including PPARalpha, mtTFA, ErbAalpha and PGC-1alpha. Our findings indicate parallel increases in myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis with 15-day T4; these changes were not present with 10-day T4 even with significant cardiac hypertrophy. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.",
            "Thyroid hormone (TH) induces marked changes in the biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle affecting its bioenergetics, contractility and structure. Using a time-course analysis of in vitro treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with triiodothyronine (T3), mitochondrial biogenesis, functional bioenergetics and cardiomyocyte hypertrophic phenotype were assessed. Activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha), were significantly elevated with 72 h T3 treatment. A time-course analysis showed an early increase (between 3 and 12 h) in activity and levels of subunits of complex IV and V, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and a late increase (at 72 h) in complex II and CS activities, mitochondrial protein content and mitochondrial respiration. Based on overall protein content and specific peptide levels (e.g. actin or myosin) only mild cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was detected. T3 mediates an early stimulation of enzymes containing mtDNA encoded subunits (e.g. complex IV and V) in contrast to a different regulatory pattern for the entirely nuclear-encoded enzymes (e.g. CS and complex II). T3-regulation was similar in both neonatal and young adult cardiomyocytes (ARCM) but absent in the senescent cardiomyocytes. This model offer an opportunity to study the rapid timing of events involved in myocardial cell signaling, bioenergetics and growth dynamics in a timeframe not available with whole animal studies.",
            "Hypothyroidism during early mammalian brain development is associated with decreased expression of various mitochondrial encoded genes along with evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction. However, in-spite of the similarities between neurological disorders caused by perinatal hypothyroidism and those caused by various genetic mitochondrial defects we still do not know as to how thyroid hormone (TH) regulates mitochondrial transcription during development and whether this regulation by TH is nuclear mediated or through mitochondrial TH receptors? We here in rat cerebellum show that hypothyroidism causes reduction in expression of nuclear encoded genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis like PGC-1alpha, NRF-1alpha and Tfam. Also, we for the first time demonstrate a mitochondrial localization of thyroid hormone receptor (mTR) isoform in developing brain capable of binding a TH response element (DR2) present in D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA. These results thus indicate an integrated nuclear-mitochondrial cross talk in regulation of mitochondrial transcription by TH during brain development.",
            "In vertebrates, skeletal muscle myofibers display different contractile and metabolic properties associated with different mitochondrial content and activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) regulating mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. When overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it increases mitochondrial DNA content, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces a shift in the metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers toward a slower and more oxidative phenotype. Here we show that a p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle in association with the induction of a more glycolytic muscle phenotype and a decrease of capillary density. In addition, p43(-/-) mice displayed a significant increase in muscle mass relative to control animals and had an improved ability to use lipids. Our findings establish that the p43 mitochondrial receptor strongly affects muscle mass and the metabolic and contractile features of myofibers and provides evidence that this receptor mediates, in part, the influence of thyroid hormone in skeletal muscle.",
            "Thyroid hormone is a major determinant of energy expenditure and a key regulator of mitochondrial activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) that acts as a mitochondrial transcription factor of the organelle genome, which leads, in vitro and in vivo, to a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we generated mice specifically lacking p43 to address its physiological influence. We found that p43 is required for normal glucose homeostasis. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, a high-fat/high-sucrose diet elicited more severe glucose intolerance than that recorded in normal animals. In addition, we observed in p43(-/-) mice both a decrease in pancreatic islet density and in the activity of complexes of the respiratory chain in isolated pancreatic islets. These dysfunctions were associated with a down-regulation of the expression of the glucose transporter Glut2 and of Kir6.2, a key component of the K(ATP) channel. Our findings establish that p43 is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and provide evidence for the first time of a physiological role for a mitochondrial endocrine receptor.",
            "Mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations contribute to various disease states characterized by low ATP production. In contrast, thyroid hormone [3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T(3))] induces mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances ATP generation within cells. To evaluate the role of T(3)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with mtDNA mutations, three fibroblast cell lines with mtDNA mutations were evaluated, including two patients with Leigh's syndrome and one with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Compared with control cells, patient fibroblasts displayed similar levels of mitochondrial mass, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) protein expression. However, patient cells exhibited a 1.6-fold elevation in ROS production, a 1.7-fold elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, a 1.2-fold elevation in mitochondrial membrane potential, and 30% less complex V activity compared with control cells. Patient cells also displayed 20-25% reductions in both cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and MnSOD protein levels compared with control cells. After T(3) treatment of patient cells, ROS production was decreased by 40%, cytoplasmic Ca2+ was reduced by 20%, COX activity was increased by 1.3-fold, and ATP levels were elevated by 1.6-fold, despite the absence of a change in mitochondrial mass. There were no significant alterations in the protein expression of PGC-1alpha, Tfam, or UCP2 in either T(3)-treated patient or control cells. However, T(3) restored the mitochondrial membrane potential, complex V activity, and levels of MnSOD to normal values in patient cells and elevated MnSOD levels by 21% in control cells. These results suggest that T(3) acts to reduce cellular oxidative stress, which may help attenuate ROS-mediated damage, along with improving mitochondrial function and energy status in cells with mtDNA defects.",
            "Thyroid hormone (T(3)) regulates the function of many tissues within the body. The effects of T(3) have largely been attributed to the modulation of thyroid hormone receptor-dependent gene transcription. However, nongenomic actions of T(3) via the initiation of signaling events are emerging in a number of cell types. This study investigated the ability of short-term T(3) treatment to phosphorylate and, therefore, activate signaling proteins in rat tissues in vivo. The kinases investigated included p38, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Following 2 h of T(3) treatment, p38 and AMPK phosphorylation was increased in both the slow-twitch soleus and the fast-twitch plantaris muscles. In contrast, ERK1/2 was not activated in either muscle type. Neither p38 nor AMPK was affected in heart. However, AMPK activation was decreased by T(3) in liver. ERK1/2 activation was decreased by T(3) in heart, but increased in liver. Possible downstream consequences of T(3)-induced kinase phosphorylation were investigated by measuring cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and thyroid hormone receptor DNA binding, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator-1 mRNA levels. Protein DNA binding to the cAMP or thyroid hormone response elements was unaltered by T(3). However, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator-1 mRNA expression was increased following 12 h of T(3) treatment in soleus. These data are the first to characterize the effects of T(3) treatment on kinase phosphorylation in vivo. We show that T(3) rapidly modifies kinase activity in a tissue-specific fashion. Moreover, the T(3)-induced phosphorylation of p38 and AMPK in both slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscles suggests that these events may be important in mediating hormone-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.",
            "In previous studies, we characterized a new hormonal pathway involving a mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) acting as a mitochondrial transcription factor. In in vitro and in vivo studies, we have shown that p43 increases mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, p43 overexpression in skeletal muscle stimulates mitochondrial respiration and induces a shift in metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers which became more oxidative.Here we have studied the influence of p43 overexpression in skeletal muscle of mice during aging. We report that p43 overexpression initially increased mitochondrial mass. However, after the early rise in mitochondrial DNA occurring at 2 months of age in transgenic mice, we observed a progressive decrease of mitochondrial DNA content which became 2-fold lower at 23 months of age relatively to control animals. Moreover, p43 overexpression induced an oxidative stress characterized by a strong increase of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in quadriceps muscle, although antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were stimulated. In addition, muscle atrophy became detectable at 6 months of age, probably through a stimulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway via two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases E3, Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1.Taken together, these results demonstrate that a prolonged stimulation of mitochondrial activity induces muscle atrophy. In addition, these data underline the importance of a tight control of p43 expression and suggest that a deregulation of the direct T3 mitochondrial pathway could be one of the parameters involved in the occurrence of sarcopenia.",
            "T3 and GH have been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Since thyroid hormone promotes the synthesis of growth hormone, its control of human mitochondrial biogenesis could arise through a permissive action on GH biosynthesis. This was studied in hypophysectomized rats treated with T3 and/or human GH by the continuous infusion of hormone for 6 days from mini-infusion pumps implanted sc. Increases in mitochondrial respiration, enzyme activities, and protein synthesis were found in isolated liver mitochondria from rats receiving T3. In contrast, GH alone had no effect, nor did it increase the response to T3. Since it has been argued that mitochondrial biogenesis results from a direct interaction (binding) of GH with mitochondria, GH-specific binding sites were measured with 125I-bGH, a specific somatogenic receptor ligand, in isolated mitochondrial membranes in vitro. In addition, the intracellular endocytic uptake of 125I-bGH injected in vivo was compared in purified subcellular membrane fractions and mitochondria. No evidence in favour of specific GH interaction on mitochondrial membranes was found by either test. It is concluded that T3 exerts a direct, rather than permissive, effect on mitochondrial biogenesis, and that high affinity binding sites for GH are not present in rat liver mitochondria.",
            "In order to analyze the role of thyroid hormones in mitochondrial biogenesis, we have studied the expression pattern of the beta subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase complex in liver and in isolated mitochondria during postnatal development of hypothyroid rats. Chemically induced hypothyroidism promoted a significant reduction in body and liver masses at all stages of development. Furthermore, plasma 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4) concentrations were significantly reduced in hypothyroid animals when compared to euthyroid animals. Remarkably, steady-state beta-F1-ATPase mRNA levels in livers of hypothyroid animals showed an approximately 50% reduction when compared to age-matched euthyroid rats at all stages of development. The relative amounts of beta-F1-ATPase protein determined in isolated mitochondria of 1-day-old and adult hypothyroid animals were similar to those determined in mitochondria of age-matched euthyroids, indicating that hypothyroidism does not affect organelle differentiation in the liver of suckling and adult rats. In contrast, the relative amount of beta-F1-ATPase protein in liver homogenates varied (0-30% reduction) due to the hypothyroid condition during development. These findings suggest the existence of compensatory mechanisms operating at the translational and/or post-translational levels which promote proliferation of mitochondria in the hypothyroid liver. However, when the liver mass was considered, hypothyroidism significantly reduced overall mitochondrial proliferation in rat liver. Interestingly, the effects of thyroid hormones on the biogenesis of the ATP synthase complex at latter stages of development provide an example in which the hypothyroid condition limits the expression of the nuclear-encoded gene with no apparent effect on the expression of the mitochondrial-encoded genes (ATP synthase subunits 6-8).",
            "Exogenous thyroid hormones are regulators of cellular metabolism that involves, along with other cell structures, mitochondria. Mechanisms of the influence of thyroid hormones on the biogenesis of mtDNA are not fully understood due to their pleiotropic nature. Different ways of regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by thyroid hormones are discussed in literature, but thyroid receptors, localized in both the nucleus and mitochondria, are the main elements of most pathways. Data on events occurring after receptor activation are rather contradictory. We investigated the degree of involvement of mitochondrial transcription factors in the biogenesis of mtDNA induced by triiodothyronine. The contribution of TFAM, TFB2M, and helicase Twinkle in thyroid-induced mtDNA biogenesis was assessed. The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis. The role of helicase Twinkle, the expression induction of which is also observed after triiodothyronine addition, remains unclear. The analysis of factors that activate TFAM and TFB2M expression showed that NRF-1 is the determinative regulator: deficiency of this factor leads to complete collapse of mtDNA biogenesis. However, lack of transcriptional coactivator PGC-1\u03b1 did not lead to significant reduction in thyroid-induced biogenesis, whereas literature data point to its key role in the biogenesis of mitochondria. Thus, in this study the role of key transcription factors in mtDNA biogenesis induced by triiodothyronine was demonstrated for the first time in a model system.",
            "Thyroid hormone is one of the few known physiological regulators of mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis. Although it exerts a global effect on biogenesis, it does so by regulating the expression of a limited number of unidentified mitochondrial proteins. We have investigated these hormone-regulated proteins in rat liver. Hormone injection induced a 30-fold increase in the levels of cytochrome-c1 mRNA after 3 d. In addition, the mRNA for the growth-activated adenine-nucleotide translocator, ANT2, was increased 13-fold and that for the ATPase N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein increased 4-5-fold. Mitochondrial transcripts of cytochrome-oxidase subunit I also increased. No changes were found in the mRNA levels for the F1-ATPase beta-subunit or cytochrome oxidase IV. A single low dose of triiodothyronine induces rapid increases in cytochrome-c1 and ANT2 mRNA species which parallel changes in the activity of the hormone-responsive malic enzyme, but are earlier than other mitochondrial biogenetic events. These data strengthen the view that thyroid hormone regulates synthesis of specific components within each respiratory-chain complex and that these products apparently play key roles in inner-membrane biogenesis and assembly. The significance of ANT2 induction is also discussed with respect to the rapid respiratory response induced by thyroid hormone.",
            "3,5,3'-Levo-triiodothyronine (L-T3) is essential for DNA transcription, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, but its circulating levels rapidly decrease after myocardial infarction (MI). The main aim of our study was to test whether an early and sustained normalization of L-T3 serum levels after MI exerts myocardial protective effects through a mitochondrial preservation. Seventy-two hours after MI induced by anterior interventricular artery ligation, rats were infused with synthetic L-T3 (1.2 \u03bcg/kg/day) or saline over 4 weeks. Compared to saline, L-T3 infusion restored FT3 serum levels at euthyroid state (3.0 \u00b1 0.2 versus 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 pg/ml), improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (39.5 \u00b1 2.5 versus 65.5 \u00b1 6.9%), preserved LV end-systolic wall thickening in the peri-infarct zone (6.34 \u00b1 3.1 versus 33.7 \u00b1 6.21%) and reduced LV infarct-scar size by approximately 50% (all P < 0.05). Moreover, L-T3 significantly increased angiogenesis and cell survival and enhanced the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors involved in these processes. Finally, L-T3 significantly increased the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1\u03b1, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, in the LV peri-infarct zone. To further explore mechanisms of L-T3 protective effects, we exposed isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes to H(2)O(2) and found that L-T3 rescued mitochondrial biogenesis and function and protected against cell death via a mitoKATP dependent pathway. Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection.",
            "The energy relationships between cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism were studied in the hearts from euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. Isolated mitochondria showed high respiratory control ratios and impermeability to exogenous NADH. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, resulted in lower and higher contents of both cytochromes per mitochondrion and mitochondrial protein per gram of wet weight of heart without changes in the ratio of cytochrome c to cytochrome aa3. In isolated perfused heart, the hyperthyroid state led to an increase in work rate and thereby an elevation of Vo2, which resulted in an increase oxidation-reduction turnover number for the cytochromes. An agreement was found between [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] of cytosolic free adenine nucleotides and the value calculated from a mathematical model of mitochondrial respiration. This implies that mitochondrial respiration is controlled at the cytochrome oxidase reaction and that oxidative phosphorylation in intact tissue is tightly coupled irrespective of thyroid state. It is concluded that thyroid hormone causes an increase in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial cytochrome content, and respiratory rate, and consequently expands the capacity of oxidative metabolism without an uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation.",
            "Thyroid hormone [3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3))] induces phenotypic alterations in cardiac mitochondria, in part by influencing protein import and the expression of the import motor mitochondrial heat shock protein (mtHsp70). Here we examined the adaptability of translocases of the inner membrane (Tim) proteins, as well as the outer membrane receptor Tom34, to T(3). Administration of T(3) to rats for 5 days increased cardiac Tim23 and Tim44 mRNA levels by 55 and 50%, respectively, but had no effect on Tim17. T(3) treatment also induced a 45% increase in Tom34 mRNA, with no accompanying changes at the protein level, suggesting regulation at the posttranscriptional level. In H9c2 cardiac cells, Tim17 mRNA was elevated by 114% by 9 days of differentiation, whereas Tim23 and Tim44 declined by 25 and 29%, respectively. To determine the functional consequences of these T(3)-induced changes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) import rates were measured in H9c2 cells stably overexpressing Tim44 and mtHsp70, either alone or in combination. MDH import remained unaltered in cells overexpressing Tim44 or in cells overexpressing both Tim44 and mtHsp70. However, when mtHsp70 was overexpressed alone, a 13% (P < 0.05) increase in MDH import rate was observed. These findings indicate that import machinery components are differentially regulated in response to stimuli that induce mitochondrial biogenesis, like T(3) and differentiation. In addition, the induction of an import machinery component in response to T(3) may not necessarily result in functional changes in protein import during mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, mtHsp70 may play a regulatory role in the import process that is independent of its interaction with Tim44."
