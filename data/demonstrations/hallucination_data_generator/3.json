A reduced incidence of postoperative AF has been described in CABG patients receiving IV tri-iodothyronine (T3). This study was designed to define the role of thyroid metabolism on the genesis of postoperative AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Free T3 (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid stimulating hormone were assayed at admission in 107 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Patients with thyroid disease or taking drugs known to interfere with thyroid function were excluded. A preoperative rhythm other than sinus rhythm was considered an exclusion criterion. Thirty-three patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF. An older age (P=0.03), no therapy with beta-blockers (P=0.08), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.08), lower left ventricle ejection fraction (P=0.09) and lower fT3 concentration (P=0.001), were univariate predictors of postoperative AF. On multivariate analysis, low fT3 concentration and lack of beta-blocking therapy were independently related with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio, OR, 4.425; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.745-11.235; P=0.001 and OR 3.107; 95% CI 1.087-8.875; P=0.03, respectively). Postoperative AF significantly prolonged postoperative hospital stay (P=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of postoperative AF in CABG patients.\n- CONTEXT: Effects of thyroid hormone therapy on postoperative morbidity and mortality in adults remain controversial.OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review evaluating effects and risks of postoperative T(3) therapy in adults.DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases and reference lists through March 2010 were searched.STUDY SELECTION: Studies with comparable control groups comparing T(3) to placebo therapy in randomized controlled trials were selected.DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently screened and reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles. Data were abstracted from 14 randomized controlled trials (13 cardiac surgery and one renal transplantation). In seven studies, iv T(3) was given in high doses (0.175-0.333 \u03bcg/kg \u00b7 h) for 6 to 9 h, in four studies iv T(3) was given in low doses (0.0275-0.0333 \u03bcg/kg \u00b7 h for 14 to 24 h), and in three studies T(3) was given orally in variable doses and durations.DATA SYNTHESIS: Both high- and low-dose iv T(3) therapy increased cardiac index after coronary artery bypass surgery. Mortality was not significantly altered by high-dose iv T(3) therapy and could not be assessed for low-dose iv or oral T(3). Effects on systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, new onset atrial fibrillation, inotrope use, serum TSH and T(4) were inconclusive.LIMITATIONS: Numbers of usable unique studies and group sizes were small. Duration of T(3) therapy was short, and dosages and routes of administration varied.CONCLUSIONS: Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac index and does not alter mortality. Effects on other parameters are inconclusive.\n- Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass produces a generalized systemic inflammatory response, resulting in increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Under these circumstances, a typical pattern of thyroid abnormalities is seen in the absence of primary disease, defined as sick euthyroid syndrome (SES). The presence of postoperative SES mainly in small children and neonates exposed to long bypass times and the pharmacological profile of thyroid hormones and their effects on the cardiovascular physiology make supplementation therapy an attractive treatment option to improve postoperative morbidity and mortality. Many studies have been performed with conflicting results. In this article, we review the important literature on the development of SES in paediatric postoperative cardiac patients, analyse the existing information on thyroid hormone replacement therapy in this patient group and try to summarize the findings for a recommendation.\n- Thyroid hormone alterations (known as the \"sick-euthyroid syndrome\") are common following major surgery, but the time course for appearance and recovery from these alterations has not previously been longitudinally studied in a large group of surgical patients. The authors prospectively studied 59 patients undergoing major surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, pneumonectomy, or subtotal colectomy). Compared with preoperative values, the mean serum T4, T3, free T3, and TSH concentrations decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) following surgery. Serum reverse T3 and T3 resin uptake index increased, while free T4 levels remained unchanged. These changes were seen within 6 hours of surgery and normalized by 1 week after surgery. Although the serum TSH response to TRH was normal before and after surgery in 56 of the 59 patients, the maximal TRH-induced increase in serum TSH and the integrated serum TSH response to TRH were suppressed in the early perioperative period. This postoperative TSH suppression correlated with elevated postoperative plasma dopamine concentrations (r = 0.57, p less than 0.05). Three patients with compensated primary hypothyroidism were detected in the study and represent the first documentation of serial thyroid hormone and TSH levels in hypothyroid patients undergoing major surgery. These patients had similar changes in thyroid hormone values compared with euthyroid patients. The serum TSH response to TRH was suppressed into the normal range in two of these patients on the day following surgery. The authors conclude that the sick-euthyroid syndrome occurs within a few hours of major surgery and remits with convalescence. Postoperative decreases in serum TSH may mask the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Surgical consultants should be aware of these rapid postoperative changes so that thyroid function tests are properly interpreted in patients who have undergone major surgery.\n- BACKGROUND: The impact of thyroid disease on patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting has been reported in only small series of selected patients.METHODS: We investigated 30-day mortality of patients on thyroxine replacement therapy undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 1993 to 2000 and identified variables of importance for outcome.RESULTS: A total of 3,631 patients (606 women) had isolated coronary artery bypass grafting of whom 58 patients (30 women) were treated for hypothyroidism. The mortality rate was higher among women with thyroxine replacement (16.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6 to 34.7) than those without thyroxine replacement (5.9%, 95% CI 4.1 to 8.2; p = 0.02) and no difference between men with (3.6%, 95% CI 0.1 to 17.8) and without (2.6%, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.2) thyroxine treatment (p = 0.8). Intake of diuretics (p < 0.001) was directly associated with mortality whereas intake of aspirin (p = 0.01), levothyroxine dose (p = 0.03), and serum thyroxine level (p = 0.01) were inversely associated with mortality among women on thyroxine replacement.CONCLUSIONS: Women on thyroxine replacement therapy undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had an increased mortality rate. We speculate that insufficient thyroid hormone replacement could partly play a role in this outcome.\n- A controversy persists as to whether cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) decreases plasma levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thereby justifying peri-operative administration of T3 to improve haemodynamic recovery. To examine the effects of T3 therapy on post-CPB haemodynamics and to determine whether the potential inotropic effects of T3 are mediated by an increase in beta-adrenergic responsiveness, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. T3 or placebo solution (10 patients in each group) was given intravenously at the time of aortic unclamping and 4, 8, 12 and 20 h thereafter. End points included (1) thyroid hormone levels measured by radioimmunoassay (2) standard haemodynamic parameters (3) the density of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors measured by a radioligand (125I-iodocyanopindolol) binding technique. Post-CPB values (cross clamp removal) of T3 (pg.ml-1) were not significantly decreased compared with pre-CPB values: 3.3 +/- 0.2 vs 3.1 +/- 0.2 in controls and 3.3 +/- 0.4 vs 3.7 +/- 0.6 in T3-treated patients, respectively. The haemodynamic parameters were no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise, density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly different from pre-operative values in either group. Thus, there seems to be no sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart procedures.\n- BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone has many effects on the cardiovascular system. During and after cardiopulmonary bypass, serum triiodothyronine concentrations decline transiently, which may contribute to postoperative hemodynamic dysfunction. We investigated whether the perioperative administration of triiodothyronine (liothyronine sodium) enhances cardiovascular performance in high-risk patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery.METHODS: We administered triiodothyronine or placebo to 142 patients with coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular function. The hormone was administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.8 microgram per kilogram of body weight when the aortic cross-clamp was removed after the completion of bypass surgery and then as an infusion of 0.113 microgram per kilogram per hour for six hours. Clinical and hemodynamic responses were serially recorded, as was any need for inotropic or vasodilator drugs.RESULTS: The patients' preoperative serum triiodothyronine concentrations were normal (mean [+/- SD] value, 81 +/- 22 ng per deciliter [1.2 +/- 0.3 nmol per liter]), and they decreased by 40 percent (P < 0.001) 30 minutes after the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass. The concentrations in patients given intravenous triiodothyronine became supranormal and were significantly higher than those in patients given placebo (P < 0.001). However, the concentrations were once again similar in the two groups 24 hours after surgery. The mean postoperative cardiac index was higher in the triiodothyronine group (2.97 +/- 0.72 vs. 2.67 +/- 0.61 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area, P = 0.007), and systemic vascular resistance was lower (1073 +/- 314 vs. 1235 +/- 387 dyn.sec.cm-5, P = 0.003). The two groups did not differ significantly in the incidence of arrhythmia or the need for therapy with inotropic and vasodilator drugs during the 24 hours after surgery, or in perioperative mortality and morbidity.CONCLUSIONS: Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy.\n- The treatment of hypothyroidism in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery is a difficult clinical problem. To determine perioperative thyroid replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism, plasma total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyroxine (T3), free T4, free T3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were measured preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after operation in 9 patients with hypothyroidism and were compared with levels in 14 patients with normal thyroid function who underwent coronary bypass surgery. In the normal control group, total T4 decreased to its lowest level on the 1st postoperative day and then increased gradually to the preoperative level at 7 days. Total T4 remained within the normal range throughout the entire postoperative course. In 6 patients with hypothyroidism who were treated with thyroid hormone before surgery, total T4 decreased immediately after operation and only increased after starting thyroid replacement therapy. In 3 hypothyroid patients without prior thyroid replacement, total T4 showed a change similar to patients in the control group but remained below the normal range until starting thyroid replacement therapy. Coronary bypass surgery was performed safely in patients with hypothyroidism. Preoperative thyroid replacement with suboptimal doses was safe in patients with severe hypothyroidism. Adequate postoperative thyroid replacement was achieved in all patients without complications.\n- A prospective randomized and double-blind study was performed to evaluate whether perioperative triiodothyronine administration has any effect on cardiovascular performance after coronary artery bypass surgery. Sixty patients were assigned to 2 groups of 30 each. When crossclamping ended, group A received an intravenous bolus of triiodothyronine, followed by infusion for 6 hours. Group B received a placebo. Serum triiodothyronine levels and hemo-dynamic parameters were serially measured. Mean postoperative cardiac index was slightly, but not significantly, higher in group A, whereas systemic vascular resistance was significantly lower in group A. Compared with preoperative values, serum triiodothyronine levels dropped significantly in group B at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass and remained low 12 hours postoperatively, while levels rose significantly in group A. No significant differences were detected between the groups in the incidence of arrhythmia, the need for inotropic support, intensive care unit stay, mortality, and morbidity. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended.\n- The question addressed in this review is whether supplementation with thyroid hormones during the perioperative period improves the outcome of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Altogether 88 relevant papers were identified using the below mentioned search, seven papers represented the best evidence to answer the question. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses were tabulated. We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.\n- OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that triiodothyronine (T(3)) administration improves hemodynamic variables and decreases inotropic drug requirements in cardiac surgery patients.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.SETTING: Tertiary care medical center.PATIENTS: A total of 211 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery at high risk for requiring inotropic drug support.INTERVENTION: At release of aortic cross-clamp, patients were randomized to an intravenous infusion of T(3) (0.8 microg/kg followed by 0.12 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) for 6 hours), dopamine (positive control, 5 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) for 6 hours) or placebo.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perioperative hemodynamic variables, inotropic support requirements, and serum T(3) concentrations.RESULTS: Mean+/-SEM free T(3) serum concentrations decreased significantly during cardiopulmonary bypass in all groups (from 0.0035+/-0.0001 nmol/L [0.23+/-0.01 ng/dL] to 0.001+/-0.0001 nmol/L [0.7+/- 0.00 ng/dL]; P=.001) and increased to 0.0133+/-0.0004 nmol/L [0.87+/-0.03 ng/dL] (twice normal range; P<.001) following initiation of intravenous T(3). Intravenous T(3) did not change hemodynamic variables or inotropic drug requirements; however, heart rate increased (P<.001), and a trend toward decreased use of inotropic agents was demonstrated in the dopamine group.CONCLUSIONS: Triiodothyronine administration prevents decreases in serum thyroid hormone concentrations associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Intravenous T(3) does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has been previously suggested. Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n- The outcome of coronary bypass surgery was analyzed in 25 patients who were on thyroxin replacement therapy for chronic thyroid disorders at the time of operation. It was hypothesized that if such patients were given only their routine dose of thyroxin on the day of surgery, hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory recovery may be poor. All the patients on thyroxin replacement therapy were given their routine dose of thyroxin orally or via a nasogastric tube in the perioperative period. No supplemental dose was used. Based on preoperative levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, 68% of these patients were biochemically hypothyroid prior to surgery. Analysis of a large number of variables showed no difference in outcome against a control group who had no previous thyroid problems. We conclude that routine thyroxin administration is all that is required for a satisfactory outcome in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery while on thyroxin replacement therapy.\n- Hypothyroidism is a common disorder affecting the cardiovascular, respiratory, hematopoietic, and renal organ systems--each of which is particularly germane in the management of the surgical patient. In general, treatment of recognized hypothyroidism is recommended before any surgical procedure whenever possible and euthyroidism should be documented by measurement of serum TSH as part of the preoperative evaluation. Such a strategy is likely to result in better surgical outcomes with improved morbidity and mortality. One exception to treating first with thyroid hormone is the patient with angina or coronary artery disease requiring bypass grafting, angioplasty or stenting. In this setting, preoperative thyroid hormone therapy could tax the ischemic myocardium. The coronary blood flow should be addressed first, and thyroid hormone therapy initiated afterwards. The authors have emphasized the need for caution in the interpretation of low serum thyroid hormones in sick or surgical patients because of the importance of distinguishing between hypothyroidism and the \"euthyroid sick syndrome.\" There is no clear evidence at this point to support thyroid hormone replacement in the latter patients, and it may be potentially harmful. Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated.\n\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\n\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\n\u2026\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\n\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\n\n\nQuestion:\nIs recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?\n\nOutput:\nNon-Hallucinated Answer:\nThe use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a topic of debate among clinicians.

            "The treatment of hypothyroidism in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery is a difficult clinical problem. To determine perioperative thyroid replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism, plasma total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyroxine (T3), free T4, free T3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were measured preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after operation in 9 patients with hypothyroidism and were compared with levels in 14 patients with normal thyroid function who underwent coronary bypass surgery.

Total T4 remained within the normal range throughout the entire postoperative course. In 6 patients with hypothyroidism who were treated with thyroid hormone before surgery, total T4 decreased immediately after operation and only increased after starting thyroid replacement therapy. In 3 hypothyroid patients without prior thyroid replacement, total T4 showed a change similar to patients in the control group but remained below the normal range until starting thyroid replacement therapy.

No significant differences were detected between the groups in the incidence of arrhythmia, the need for inotropic support, intensive care unit stay, mortality, and morbidity. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended.",
            "The question addressed in this review is whether supplementation with thyroid hormones during the perioperative period improves the outcome of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Altogether 88 relevant papers were identified using the below mentioned search, seven papers represented the best evidence to answer the question. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses were tabulated. We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.",
            "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that triiodothyronine (T(3)) administration improves hemodynamic variables and decreases inotropic drug requirements in cardiac surgery patients.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.SETTING: Tertiary care medical center.PATIENTS: A total of 211 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery at high risk for requiring inotropic drug support.INTERVENTION: At release of aortic cross-clamp, patients were randomized to an intravenous infusion of T(3) (0.8 microg/kg followed by 0.12 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) for 6 hours), dopamine (positive control, 5 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) for 6 hours) or placebo.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perioperative hemodynamic variables, inotropic support requirements, and serum T(3) concentrations.RESULTS: Mean+/-SEM free T(3) serum concentrations decreased significantly during cardiopulmonary bypass in all groups (from 0.0035+/-0.0001 nmol/L [0.23+/-0.01 ng/dL] to 0.001+/-0.0001 nmol/L [0.7+/- 0.00 ng/dL]; P=.001) and increased to 0.0133+/-0.0004 nmol/L [0.87+/-0.03 ng/dL] (twice normal range; P<.001) following initiation of intravenous T(3). Intravenous T(3) did not change hemodynamic variables or inotropic drug requirements; however, heart rate increased (P<.001), and a trend toward decreased use of inotropic agents was demonstrated in the dopamine group.CONCLUSIONS: Triiodothyronine administration prevents decreases in serum thyroid hormone concentrations associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Intravenous T(3) does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has been previously suggested. Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",
            "The outcome of coronary bypass surgery was analyzed in 25 patients who were on thyroxin replacement therapy for chronic thyroid disorders at the time of operation. It was hypothesized that if such patients were given only their routine dose of thyroxin on the day of surgery, hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory recovery may be poor. All the patients on thyroxin replacement therapy were given their routine dose of thyroxin orally or via a nasogastric tube in the perioperative period. No supplemental dose was used. Based on preoperative levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, 68% of these patients were biochemically hypothyroid prior to surgery. Analysis of a large number of variables showed no difference in outcome against a control group who had no previous thyroid problems. We conclude that routine thyroxin administration is all that is required for a satisfactory outcome in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery while on thyroxin replacement therapy.",
            "Hypothyroidism is a common disorder affecting the cardiovascular, respiratory, hematopoietic, and renal organ systems--each of which is particularly germane in the management of the surgical patient. In general, treatment of recognized hypothyroidism is recommended before any surgical procedure whenever possible and euthyroidism should be documented by measurement of serum TSH as part of the preoperative evaluation. Such a strategy is likely to result in better surgical outcomes with improved morbidity and mortality. One exception to treating first with thyroid hormone is the patient with angina or coronary artery disease requiring bypass grafting, angioplasty or stenting. In this setting, preoperative thyroid hormone therapy could tax the ischemic myocardium. The coronary blood flow should be addressed first, and thyroid hormone therapy initiated afterwards. The authors have emphasized the need for caution in the interpretation of low serum thyroid hormones in sick or surgical patients because of the importance of distinguishing between hypothyroidism and the \"euthyroid sick syndrome.\" There is no clear evidence at this point to support thyroid hormone replacement in the latter patients, and it may be potentially harmful. Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated."

        "Non-Hallucinated Answer:\nThe use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a topic of debate among clinicians. While some studies suggest that administering triiodothyronine (T3) can improve hemodynamic outcomes, the overall evidence does not support routine use. For instance, a systematic review identified that although T3 administration can increase cardiac index, it does not significantly alter mortality or the need for inotropic support (P=0.007) (reference). Furthermore, the phenomenon known as \"sick euthyroid syndrome\" often complicates the interpretation of thyroid hormone levels in surgical patients, making it crucial to distinguish between true hypothyroidism and transient thyroid hormone alterations due to surgery (reference). Therefore, while thyroid hormone replacement may be beneficial in specific cases, particularly in patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, the general consensus is that routine perioperative thyroid hormone therapy is not recommended for all CABG patients.\n\nHallucinated Answer:\nThe use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a topic of debate among clinicians.
