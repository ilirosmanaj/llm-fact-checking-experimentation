It involves administering high doses of potassium iodide to block the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. This intervention is especially important in situations where there is a release of radioiodine into the atmosphere, as it can help prevent the long-term health consequences associated with thyroid cancer. The effectiveness of ITB has been recognized, but potential adverse effects have not been systematically investigated, leading to a weak evidence base regarding its safety.\nOutput:\n[[\"Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB)\", \"is\", \"a protective measure used to reduce the risk of developing thyroid cancer following exposure to radioactive iodine in the context of a nuclear accident\"], [\"Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB)\", \"involves\", \"administering high doses of potassium iodide to block the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland\"], [\"Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB)\", \"is especially important in\", \"situations where there is a release of radioiodine into the atmosphere\"], [\"Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB)\", \"can help prevent\", \"the long-term health consequences associated with thyroid cancer\"], [\"The effectiveness of iodine thyroid blocking (ITB)\", \"has been recognized, but\", \"potential adverse effects have not been systematically investigated\"], [\"The lack of systematic investigation of potential adverse effects\", \"has led to\", \"a weak evidence base regarding the safety of iodine thyroid blocking (ITB)\"]]\n\n",
