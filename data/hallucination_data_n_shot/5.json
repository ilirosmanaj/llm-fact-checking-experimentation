All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid hormone, both before and after the administration of thyroid hormones, highlight the striking intrafamilial heterogeneity in the phenotypical presentation of the syndrome.\\n- Clinical syndromes of hormone resistance or independence have baffled clinicians for decades. These syndromes sometimes result from mutations or deficiencies in enzymes that activate prohormones or from alterations in signal transduction proteins. The majority of these conditions, however, arise from abnormalities of hormone receptors. We describe examples of syndromes that result from genetic mutations or misexpression of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, with a specific emphasis on thyroid and androgen resistance syndromes, and estrogen independence in breast cancer.\\n- Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8- to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine abnormalities were detected. The defect developed de novo in the proposita and was transmitted to her two children of unrelated fathers. As cultured fibroblasts from the proposita responded poorly to T3 despite a normal concentration of TR, other abnormalities in the mediation of T3 action were sought. Nucleotide sequences of the TSH beta promoter, containing thyroid hormone response elements, and TR-interacting protein 1 were normal. Nuclear extracts (NE) of cultured skin fibroblasts from affected individuals of this family were tested for their interaction with normal TR beta and thyroid hormone response elements by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NE from the proposita showed a strong additional band compared to NEs from normal individuals and patients with RTH caused by TR beta mutations or deletion. Far Western analysis of NE from the affected daughter hybridized with labeled TR beta demonstrated an additional band that was not seen in NEs from a normal control or patients with TR beta gene defects. It is concluded that the etiology of RTH is not confined to abnormalities in the TR beta gene. An abnormal cofactor with a specific function in the regulation of thyroid hormone action is probably involved in the expression of the RTH phenotype in this family.\\n- The thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are disorders in which the body\\'s tissues are resistant to the effects of thyroid hormone. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland and in most or all of the peripheral tissues. Affected individuals have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and inappropriately normal or elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) but are usually clinically euthyroid and require no treatment. Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (PRTH) is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland but not in peripheral tissues. Patients have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and normal or elevated TSH levels and are clinically thyrotoxic. Therapy is usually necessary, but current choices are not completely satisfactory. Selective peripheral resistance to thyroid hormone (PerRTH) is characterized by resistance in peripheral tissues but not in the pituitary. The only patient thus far described had normal serum thyroid hormone and TSH levels but was clinically hypothyroid and improved with thyroid hormone administration. All of these disorders are probably more common than is generally recognized and are often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. GRTH, in most cases studied, results from a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene causing an amino acid substitution in or a partial or complete deletion of the thyroid hormone-binding domain of the receptor. The causes of PRTH and PerRTH remain to be determined.\\n- Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is usually dominantly inherited and is characterized by elevated free thyroid hormones in the serum and failure to suppress pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion with variable refractoriness to hormone action in peripheral tissues. Two major forms of the disorder are recognized: asymptomatic individuals with generalized resistance (GRTH) and patients with thyrotoxic features, suggesting predominant pituitary resistance (PRTH). Molecular genetic analyses indicate that both GRTH and PRTH are associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, which localize to three regions in the hormone binding domain of the receptor. In addition to being functionally impaired, the mutant receptors are also able to inhibit their wild-type counterparts in a dominant negative manner. Recognized features of RTH include failure to thrive, growth retardation and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood, and goitre and thyrotoxic cardiac symptoms in adults. The pathogenesis of variable tissue resistance is not fully understood but may be related to the differing tissue distributions of a and b thyroid hormone receptors and variable dominant negative activity of mutant receptors on different target genes.\\n- Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression. Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This \"inappropriate\" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism, where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually present with goiter and an euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid metabolic state. Thus, pituitary resistance results in hypersecretion of TSH, which compensates, at least in part, for hormone resistance in peripheral tissues. Despite this compensation, clinical effects of RTH can include short stature, delayed bone maturation, hyperactivity, learning disabilities, and hearing defects, as well as variable features of hyper- and hypothyroidism. With the exception of a single sibship, which harbored a deletion of the entire coding sequence of the TR beta gene and a recessive pattern of inheritance, all other cases of RTH have been inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or have been de novo heterozygous mutations of the TR beta gene. The dominant pattern of inheritance is explained by the functional properties of the mutant receptors which act in a dominant negative manner to block the activity of normal TR alpha and TR beta receptors. Now that a large number of different RTH mutations have been identified, it is striking that the mutations are clustered within restricted domains in the carboxyterminal region of the receptor. Mutations in these regions have been shown to preserve critical receptor functions such as dimerization and DNA binding, while inactivating other activites such as T3 binding and transcriptional activation. The examination of patients with RTH and their mutated receptors has provided important insights into the mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, the structure-function relationship of the receptors, and the molecular mechanisms of dominant negative activity.\\n- CONTEXT: Recently the first patients with inactivating mutations in T\u2083 receptor (TR)-\u03b11 have been identified. These patients have low free T\u2084, low T\u2084, high T\u2083, low rT\u2083, and normal TSH serum levels, in combination with growth retardation, delayed bone development, and constipation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to report the effects of levothyroxine (LT4) treatment on the clinical phenotype of 2 patients (father and daughter) with a heterozygous inactivating mutation in TR\u03b11.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Both patients were treated with LT4 for the last 5 years. To evaluate the effect of LT4 treatment, LT4 was withdrawn for 35 days and subsequently reinitiated. Data were collected from medical records, by reanalysis of serum collected over the last 6 years, and by a detailed clinical evaluation.RESULTS: Treatment with LT4 resulted in a suppression of serum TSH and normalization of serum free T\u2084 and rT\u2083, whereas T\u2083 levels remained elevated in both patients. In addition, there was a normalization of the dyslipidemia as well as a response in serum IGF-I, SHBG, and creatine kinase in the index patient. All these parameters returned to pretreatment values when LT4 was briefly stopped. LT4 also resulted in an improvement of certain clinical features, such as constipation and nerve conductance. However, cognitive and fine motor skill defects remained.CONCLUSION: This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TR\u03b11. LT4 therapy leads to an improvement of certain but not all features of the clinical phenotype.\\n- Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that mediate the biological activities of thyroid hormone (T3). Two THR genes (A and B), located on different chromosomes, yield four T3-binding isoforms with highly conserved sequences in the DNA- and ligand-binding domains. Mutations of THRB cause a human genetic disease, thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH). Comprehensive genomic profiling unveiled the contribution of novel change-of-function mutations of TRbeta to the pathogenesis of RTH. In addition, abnormalities associated with mutations of the THRA gene have been uncovered recently. The phenotypic manifestations of mutated THRB and THRA genes are distinct, indicating isoform-dependent actions of TR mutants in vivo. Therefore, mutant TRs provide a new paradigm to understand the molecular basis of receptor disease.\\n- Nuclear hormone receptors are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play critical roles in chordate development and homeostasis. Aberrant nuclear hormone receptors have been implicated as causal agents in a number of endocrine and neoplastic diseases. The syndrome of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) is a human genetic disease characterized by an impaired physiological response to thyroid hormone. RTH is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta-gene. The resulting mutant receptors function as dominant negatives, interfering with the actions of normal thyroid hormone receptors coexpressed in the same cells. We report here that RTH receptors interact aberrantly with a newly recognized family of transcriptional corepressors variously denoted as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR), retinoid X receptor interacting protein-13 (RIP-13), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), and thyroid hormone receptor-associating cofactor (TRAC). All RTH receptors tested exhibit an impaired ability to dissociate from corepressors in the presence of thyroid hormone. Two of the RTH mutations uncouple corepressor dissociation from hormone binding; two additional RTH mutants exhibit an unusually strong interaction with corepressor under all hormone conditions tested. Finally, artificial mutants that abolish corepressor binding abrogate the dominant negative activity of RTH mutants. We suggest that an altered corepressor interaction is likely to play a critical role in the dominant negative potency of RTH mutants and may contribute to the variable phenotype in this disorder.\\n- We here described a 39-year-old woman with a severe chronic mood disorder, refractory to antidepressive therapy who showed a significant improvement after a self-prescription of high doses of liothyronine (T(3)). A modified Refetoff protocol was carried out to study the role of thyroid hormones on her clinical and biochemical responses. Depression severity was assessed by the HAM-D and MADRS Depression Rating Scales. Sequencing of Thyroid Receptors (TR) alpha1 and beta1 genes was done. At the final stage of the study, plasma T3 and free T3 were >800 ng/dl (80-180) and 1409 pg/dl (230-420), respectively. No changes in the cardiovascular parameters, alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, creatinine kinase, or ferritin were observed. However, an improvement in mood was detected by specific scores (HAM-D 24 to 8; MADRS 40 to 11). No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality. These results support the existence of a peripheral RTH manifestation as a refractory chronic depression reverted by high doses of T(3). Screening for RTH in refractory chronic depression may provide an alternative treatment for this psychiatric condition.\\n- The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid potential misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.\\n- BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones govern a wide range of metabolic processes in the body via thyroid hormone receptors (TR). We report a patient with mild resistance to thyroid hormone who was initially misdiagnosed and treated as having thyrotoxicosis.METHODS: We used direct DNA sequencing of the THRB gene.RESULTS: We identified a novel missense mutation, I276L, located in exon 8 of the gene. The mutation is located in cluster 3 of the ligand-binding domain, a protein domain associated with resistance to thyroid hormone.CONCLUSION: DNA-based diagnosis of thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is simple, reliable, and economical compared to traditional biochemical tests. Once the mutation is identified, targeted screening for the whole family can be performed and the unnecessary use of anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy can be avoided.\\n- Most patients with the syndrome resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) express a mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) with transdominant negative transcriptional effects. Since no patient with a mutant TRalpha has been identified, we introduced a point mutation into the mouse thyroid hormone receptor (TRalpha1) locus originally found in the TRbeta gene, that reduces ligand binding 10-fold. Heterozygous 2- to 3-week- old mice exhibit a severe retardation of post-natal development and growth, but only a minor reduction in serum thyroxine levels. Homozygous mice died before 3 weeks of age. Adult heterozygotes overcome most of these defects except for cardiac function abnormalities, suggesting that other factors compensate for the receptor defect. However, the additional deletion of the TRbeta gene in this mouse strain caused a 10-fold increase in serum thyroxine, restored hormonal regulation of target genes for TRs, and rescued the growth retardation. The data demonstrate a novel array of effects mediated by a dominant negative TRalpha1, and may provide important clues for identification of a potentially unrecognized human disorder and its treatment.\\n- Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment in growth. Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. Furthermore, abnormal expression patterns of T3-target genes in TR betaPV mice were altered by the lack of TR alpha1. These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH. This compensatory role may be especially crucial for postnatal growth.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nAre thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?\\n\\nTask:\\n 1.

Mutations in these regions have been shown to preserve critical receptor functions such as dimerization and DNA binding, while inactivating other activites such as T3 binding and transcriptional activation. The examination of patients with RTH and their mutated receptors has provided important insights into the mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, the structure-function relationship of the receptors, and the molecular mechanisms of dominant negative activity.", "CONTEXT: Recently the first patients with inactivating mutations in T\u2083 receptor (TR)-\u03b11 have been identified. These patients have low free T\u2084, low T\u2084, high T\u2083, low rT\u2083, and normal TSH serum levels, in combination with growth retardation, delayed bone development, and constipation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to report the effects of levothyroxine (LT4) treatment on the clinical phenotype of 2 patients (father and daughter) with a heterozygous inactivating mutation in TR\u03b11.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Both patients were treated with LT4 for the last 5 years. To evaluate the effect of LT4 treatment, LT4 was withdrawn for 35 days and subsequently reinitiated. Data were collected from medical records, by reanalysis of serum collected over the last 6 years, and by a detailed clinical evaluation.RESULTS: Treatment with LT4 resulted in a suppression of serum TSH and normalization of serum free T\u2084 and rT\u2083, whereas T\u2083 levels remained elevated in both patients. In addition, there was a normalization of the dyslipidemia as well as a response in serum IGF-I, SHBG, and creatine kinase in the index patient. All these parameters returned to pretreatment values when LT4 was briefly stopped. LT4 also resulted in an improvement of certain clinical features, such as constipation and nerve conductance. However, cognitive and fine motor skill defects remained.CONCLUSION: This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TR\u03b11. LT4 therapy leads to an improvement of certain but not all features of the clinical phenotype.", "Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that mediate the biological activities of thyroid hormone (T3). Two THR genes (A and B), located on different chromosomes, yield four T3-binding isoforms with highly conserved sequences in the DNA- and ligand-binding domains. Mutations of THRB cause a human genetic disease, thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH). Comprehensive genomic profiling unveiled the contribution of novel change-of-function mutations of TRbeta to the pathogenesis of RTH. In addition, abnormalities associated with mutations of the THRA gene have been uncovered recently. The phenotypic manifestations of mutated THRB and THRA genes are distinct, indicating isoform-dependent actions of TR mutants in vivo. Therefore, mutant TRs provide a new paradigm to understand the molecular basis of receptor disease.", "Nuclear hormone receptors are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play critical roles in chordate development and homeostasis. Aberrant nuclear hormone receptors have been implicated as causal agents in a number of endocrine and neoplastic diseases. The syndrome of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) is a human genetic disease characterized by an impaired physiological response to thyroid hormone. RTH is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta-gene. The resulting mutant receptors function as dominant negatives, interfering with the actions of normal thyroid hormone receptors coexpressed in the same cells. We report here that RTH receptors interact aberrantly with a newly recognized family of transcriptional corepressors variously denoted as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR), retinoid X receptor interacting protein-13 (RIP-13), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), and thyroid hormone receptor-associating cofactor (TRAC). All RTH receptors tested exhibit an impaired ability to dissociate from corepressors in the presence of thyroid hormone. Two of the RTH mutations uncouple corepressor dissociation from hormone binding; two additional RTH mutants exhibit an unusually strong interaction with corepressor under all hormone conditions tested. Finally, artificial mutants that abolish corepressor binding abrogate the dominant negative activity of RTH mutants. We suggest that an altered corepressor interaction is likely to play a critical role in the dominant negative potency of RTH mutants and may contribute to the variable phenotype in this disorder.", "We here described a 39-year-old woman with a severe chronic mood disorder, refractory to antidepressive therapy who showed a significant improvement after a self-prescription of high doses of liothyronine (T(3)). A modified Refetoff protocol was carried out to study the role of thyroid hormones on her clinical and biochemical responses. Depression severity was assessed by the HAM-D and MADRS Depression Rating Scales. Sequencing of Thyroid Receptors (TR) alpha1 and beta1 genes was done. At the final stage of the study, plasma T3 and free T3 were >800 ng/dl (80-180) and 1409 pg/dl (230-420), respectively. No changes in the cardiovascular parameters, alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, creatinine kinase, or ferritin were observed. However, an improvement in mood was detected by specific scores (HAM-D 24 to 8; MADRS 40 to 11). No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality. These results support the existence of a peripheral RTH manifestation as a refractory chronic depression reverted by high doses of T(3). Screening for RTH in refractory chronic depression may provide an alternative treatment for this psychiatric condition.", "The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid potential misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.", "BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones govern a wide range of metabolic processes in the body via thyroid hormone receptors (TR). We report a patient with mild resistance to thyroid hormone who was initially misdiagnosed and treated as having thyrotoxicosis.METHODS: We used direct DNA sequencing of the THRB gene.RESULTS: We identified a novel missense mutation, I276L, located in exon 8 of the gene. The mutation is located in cluster 3 of the ligand-binding domain, a protein domain associated with resistance to thyroid hormone.CONCLUSION: DNA-based diagnosis of thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is simple, reliable, and economical compared to traditional biochemical tests. Once the mutation is identified, targeted screening for the whole family can be performed and the unnecessary use of anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy can be avoided.", "Most patients with the syndrome resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) express a mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) with transdominant negative transcriptional effects. Since no patient with a mutant TRalpha has been identified, we introduced a point mutation into the mouse thyroid hormone receptor (TRalpha1) locus originally found in the TRbeta gene, that reduces ligand binding 10-fold. Heterozygous 2- to 3-week- old mice exhibit a severe retardation of post-natal development and growth, but only a minor reduction in serum thyroxine levels. Homozygous mice died before 3 weeks of age. Adult heterozygotes overcome most of these defects except for cardiac function abnormalities, suggesting that other factors compensate for the receptor defect. However, the additional deletion of the TRbeta gene in this mouse strain caused a 10-fold increase in serum thyroxine, restored hormonal regulation of target genes for TRs, and rescued the growth retardation. The data demonstrate a novel array of effects mediated by a dominant negative TRalpha1, and may provide important clues for identification of a potentially unrecognized human disorder and its treatment.", "Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment in growth. Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. Furthermore, abnormal expression patterns of T3-target genes in TR betaPV mice were altered by the lack of TR alpha1. These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH. This compensatory role may be especially crucial for postnatal growth."]}
