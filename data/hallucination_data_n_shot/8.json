To date, this has been reported in four Asian patients with autoimmune hyperthyroidism. Here we describe a Caucasian woman who developed a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)-like interstitial pneumonia after PTU administration for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.PATIENT FINDINGS: The patient was a 68-year-old woman who had been treated with amiodarone for chronic atrial fibrillation starting in May 2004. She had been a heavy smoker with a history of hypertension but no dust exposures. In October 2006, amiodarone was stopped after she developed thyrotoxicosis. In January 2007 serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.01\\u2009mIU/L (0.35-4.94) and free T4 was 17.5\\u2009pg/mL (7 to 15). She was initially started on methimazole and then changed to PTU after she developed pruritus. She developed severe dyspnea 9 months after starting PTU. At the time she was also taking warfarin, enalapril, and sotalol. Chest X-ray showed diffuse interstitial peripheral opacities and transbronchial lung biopsy revealed subacute lung injury with organizing pneumonia with hyperplasia of the alveolar type 2 pneumocytes, and characteristics of BOOP-like interstitial pneumonia. Signs and symptoms progressively improved after PTU discontinuation as confirmed at X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and by respiratory function tests. She has been recurrence free for 4 years after stopping PTU.SUMMARY: This woman of Caucasian ancestral origin developed BOOP-like interstitial pneumonia after PTU treatment for apparent amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, with resolution of her lung disease after stopping PTU. Tests for TSH receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and antinuclear cytoplasmic autoantibody were negative. Thyroid ultrasound was consistent with thyroiditis without nodules.CONCLUSIONS: PTU-associated interstitial pneumonia is not limited to patients of Asian origin or those with autoimmune thyroid disease. PTU must be withdrawn in the presence of respiratory symptoms and documented interstitial pneumonia. X-ray films, CT-scan, respiratory function tests, and lung biopsy are needed to diagnose PTU-induced interstitial pneumonia with certainty and to monitor the evolution of the disease after PTU discontinuation.\\n- BACKGROUND: Oral glucocorticoids are administered in moderate and severe cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT), providing dramatic relief from pain and fever. However, there have been no reports regarding the optimal dose of prednisolone (PSL) for treatment of SAT. In this study, we used 15 mg/day of PSL as the initial dosage and tapered it by 5 mg every 2 weeks. We assessed the effectiveness of this treatment protocol.METHODS: We examined 384 consecutive and untreated patients with SAT who visited our thyroid clinic between February 2005 and December 2008. We excluded patients who did not fit our protocol, and the final number of subjects was 219. When patients complained of pain in their neck or C-reactive protein (CRP) was still high, physicians were able to extend the tapering of the dose of PSL or increase it at 2-week intervals. The endpoint of the study was the duration of the PSL medication. We also compared the severity of thyrotoxicosis and rate of hypothyroidism after SAT between the short medication group (patients who recovered within 6 weeks) and long medication group (patients who recovered in 12 weeks or more).RESULTS: The number of patients whose thyroiditis improved within 6 weeks and did not recur was 113 (51.6%), and 61 (27.9%) improved within 7 to 8 weeks and did not have a recurrence. The longest duration was 40 weeks. Seven patients (3.2%) needed increases in the dosage of PSL. Thyroid hormone (free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine) levels measured at the initial visit in the short medication group were significantly higher than those in the long medication group (p<0.05). Serum CRP, male-to-female ratio, body weight, and age showed no differences between the two groups. There were no differences in the rate of hypothyroidism after SAT between the two groups (p=0.0632).CONCLUSIONS: The treatment protocol that we employed had 15 mg/day of PSL as the initial dosage for the treatment of SAT, with tapering by 5 mg every 2 weeks, and was effective and safe for Japanese patients. However, 20% of patients with SAT needed longer than 8 weeks to recover from the inflammation.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is the treatment of subacute thyroiditis?\\n\\nTask:\\n 1.
