Excess thyroid hormone is, however, associated with unwanted effects on the heart, bone and skeletal muscle. We therefore need analogs that harness the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone without the untoward effects. Such work is largely based on understanding the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, specifically the crystal structure of the nuclear receptor proteins. In clinical studies, use of naturally occurring thyroid hormone analogs can suppress TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer without producing tachycardia. Many thyromimetic compounds have been tested in animal models and shown to increase total body oxygen consumption, and to lower weight and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels while having minor effects on heart rate. Alternatively, analogs that specifically enhance both systolic and diastolic function are potentially useful in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. In addition to analogs that are thyroid hormone receptor agonists, several compounds that are thyroid hormone receptor antagonists have been identified and tested. This Review discusses the potential application of thyroid hormone analogs (both agonists and antagonists) in a variety of human disease states.\\n- Previous studies have established that reductions in repolarizing currents occur in heart disease and can contribute to life-threatening arrhythmias in myocardium. In this study, we investigated whether the thyroid hormone analog 3, 5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) could restore repolarizing transient outward K(+) current (I(to)) density and gene expression in rat myocardium after myocardial infarction (MI). Our findings show that I(to) density was reduced after MI (14.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 10.2 +/- 0.9 pA/pF, sham vs. post-MI at +40 mV). mRNA levels of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 genes were decreased but Kv1.4 mRNA levels were increased post-MI. Corresponding changes in Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 protein were also observed. Chronic treatment of post-MI rats with 10 mg/kg DITPA restored I(to) density (to 15.2 +/- 1.1 pA/pF at +40 mV) as well as Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 expression to levels observed in sham-operated controls. Other membrane currents (Na(+), L-type Ca(2+), sustained, and inward rectifier K(+) currents) were unaffected by DITPA treatment. Associated with the changes in I(to) expression, action potential durations (current-clamp recordings in isolated single right ventricular myocytes and monophasic action potential recordings from the right free wall in situ) were prolonged after MI and restored with DITPA treatment. Our results demonstrate that DITPA restores I(to) density in the setting of MI, which may be useful in preventing complications associated with I(to) downregulation.\\n- The patent application WO2008106213 describes the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone analogue 3,5 diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) such as stimulating weight loss in overweight mammals, lowering of triglyceride and treating metabolic syndrome in humans. The human population of the patients selected in the studies mentioned has a body mass index > 25. Two examples of the human clinical studies employing DITPA have been mentioned, namely, the body weight reduction and improvement in metabolic abnormalities in obese adults.\\n- CONTEXT: Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a thyroid hormone-specific cell membrane transporter. MCT8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid tests. The great majority of affected children cannot walk or talk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue hypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone is ineffective. In Mct8-deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT8 to enter tissues and could be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect and efficacy of DITPA in children with MCT8 deficiency.METHODS: This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on compassionate grounds for 26-40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8.5-25 months, beginning with a small dose of 1.8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg/d (2.1-2.4 mg/kg \u00b7 d), given in three divided doses.RESULTS: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg \u00b7 d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The following significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all subjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). Cholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain occurred in two. None of the treated children required a gastric feeding tube or developed seizures. No adverse effects were observed.CONCLUSION: DITPA (1-2 mg/kg \u00b7 d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and reduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss. The effects of earlier commencement and long-term therapy remain to be determined.\\n- To determine the biochemical and related functional effects of the thyroid analog diiodothyroproprionic acid (DITPA) on primate myocardium, we examined, both before and after 23 days of DITPA (3.75 mg/kg): myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoforms and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium cycling proteins; left ventricular (LV) function; and the LV force-frequency relation in four baboons chronically instrumented with sonomicrometers and micromanometers. The force-frequency relation was measured as the response of isovolumic contraction (dP/dtmax) to incremental pacing and the critical heart rate (HRcrit) as the rate at which dP/dtmax reached its maximum. DITPA increased basal LV dPt/dtmax (3,300 +/- 378 versus 2,943 +/- 413 mm Hg/sec; p = .09), and velocity of circumferential shortening (1.13 +/- 0.30 versus 0.76 +/- 0.30 circ/sec; p < .01), decreased the basal time constant of isovolumic relaxation (24.2 +/- 1.6 versus 29.9 +/- 2.5 msec; p < .05), and increased the HRcrit (203 +/- 19 versus 168 +/- 20 bpm; p < .05), without effecting significant changes in either basal heart rate (119 +/- 14 versus 111 +/- 17 bpm) or systolic blood pressure (137 +/- 14 versus 126 +/- 8 mm Hg). Quantitative immunoblotting revealed significant decreases in both phospholamban and the ratio of phospholamban to SR Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase in DITPA-treated animals when compared to four untreated controls. By contrast, alpha-MHC isoform was undetectable in both DITPA treated and control baboons. Thus, DITPA favorably alters the stoichiometry between the SR calcium pump and its inhibitor, phospholamban, and has positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the normal primate left ventricle, which may be useful in the treatment of heart failure. Unlike thyroid hormone, these changes occur in the absence of detectable alpha-MHC isoform protein expression and without an increase in heart rate.\\n- Patients with hypothyroidism are at a higher risk for coronary vascular disease. Patients with diabetes and related vascular complications also have an increased incidence of low thyroid function. While thyroid hormones (THs) may be key regulators of a healthy vasculature, potential undesirable side effects hinder their use in the treatment of vascular disorders. TH analogs such as 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) may provide a safer treatment option. However, the relative potency of DITPA on vascular growth, cardiac function, and metabolism is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the vascular growth-promoting effects of DITPA can be obtained with a minimum effect on cardiac function. Thyroidectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were given slow-release pellets with either thyroxine (T4, 2.7 or 5.2 mg) or DITPA (80 mg) for 6 wk and were compared with placebo. Heart mass, body mass, body temperature, serum THs, cardiac function (echocardiograms and hemodynamics), and myocardial arteriolar density were determined. Hypothyroidism led to reductions in cardiac function, heart mass, body temperature, and myocardial arterioles. High-dose T4 prevented arteriolar loss and the development of hypothyroidism. Low-dose T4 partially prevented the reduction in cardiac function but had minimal effects on arteriolar loss. In contrast, DITPA treatment prevented myocardial arteriolar loss but not the progression of hypothyroid-induced changes in cardiac function. The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects. Drugs in this class may provide new therapeutic options for patients with vascular disease.\\n- In view of the evidence that thyroid hormone administration has angiogenic effects on the hypertrophic myocardium, we tested the hypothesis that the capillary supply in the hypertrophic myocardium surviving infarction would be improved by administration of the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyroproprionic acid (DITPA). We administered DITPA (MI-DITPA) or saline (MI-saline), s.c., to rats for 10 days following experimental infarction of the left ventricle (LV). Morphometric methods were used to assess capillarity and myocyte cross-sectional area in three regions of the left ventricle: (1) border (next to the scar of infarction); (2) adjacent (next to the border); and (3) remote (interventricular septum). Infarct size ranged from 20-85% of the LV free-wall, and both groups had similar mean infarct size. Capillary length density (LV) was significantly higher in the remote region of the treated group than in the MI-saline rats. LV in the border region, which experienced the most marked increase in cardiocyte cross-sectional area, was not significantly lower than in the other regions, indicating a more marked angiogenic response. In hearts with large infarcts (> or = 40%) LV in the border region was higher in the DITPA group than in the non-treated rats. In the MI-DITPA group, cardiocyte size in the border region was positively correlated with that of the other regions, which contrasts with the negative correlations noted for the MI-saline rats. These data suggest that DITPA therapy (1) may improve maximal perfusion potential of the hypertrophied myocardium surviving a myocardial infarction, and (2) is selectively effective in the border region of hearts with large infarcts.\\n- The heart is an important target of thyroid hormone actions. Only a limited number of cardiac target genes have been identified, and little is known about their regulation by T(3) (3,3\\',5-triiodothyronine) and thyroid hormone analogs. We used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify novel cardiac genes regulated by T(3) and two thyroid hormone analogs, 3,5-diidodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and CGS 23425 [N-[3,5-dimethyl-4-(4\\'-hydroxy-3\\'-isopropylphenoxy)-phenyl]-oxamic acid]. DITPA binds with lower affinity than T(3) to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 and beta1 isoforms, whereas CGS 23425 binds selectively to beta1. Fluorescent-labeled cDNA was prepared from cultured heart cells maintained in medium stripped of thyroid hormone (\"hypothyroid\" control) or treated with T(3), DITPA, and CGS 23425 at concentrations 5 times their respective K(d) values for 48 h. The arrays were scanned and analyzed using an analysis of variance program. Sixty-four genes were identified that were >1.5 times up- or down-regulated by one of the treatments with P < 0.05. The genes regulated by T(3) and DITPA were nearly identical. Thirteen genes were differentially regulated by CGS 23425. Genes encoding contractile proteins, Ca(2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and several proteins of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, were up-regulated by T(3) and DITPA but not by CGS 23425. These results indicate that some, but not all, of the actions of thyroid hormone analogs can be explained by differences in gene activation.\\n- CONTEXT: Widespread thyroid hormone actions offer the possibility of developing selective thyromimetic analogs with salutary metabolic properties. Consequently, effects of diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers were studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-wk trial, which was primarily designed to assess treatment of stable chronic heart failure.DESIGN: Eighty-six patients (aged 66 +/- 11 yr, mean +/- sd) were randomized (1:2) to placebo or an escalating DITPA dose (90 to 180, 270, and 360 mg/d) over 8 wk until serum TSH was less than 0.02 mU/liter. Patients were studied at 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 wk and after 4 wk off study drug. Only 21 DITPA-treated and 27 placebo patients completed the full 24 wk of therapy.RESULTS: DITPA therapy lowered serum TSH levels and, to a lesser extent, serum T(3) and T(4), but there were no differences in clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels both decreased on DITPA; there was a transient decrease in triglycerides and no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. DITPA therapy was associated with significant reduction in body weight, 12.5 lb at 24 wk. Increases in serum osteocalcin, N-telopeptide, and deoxypyridinoline levels were consistent with increased bone turnover on DITPA.CONCLUSION: This investigation of DITPA actions demonstrated its efficacy in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, DITPA\\'s adverse effects at doses used resulted in a high dropout rate and potentially dangerous skeletal actions were observed.\\n- After an initial safety study in 7 normal volunteers, a randomized double-blind comparison was made between 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and placebo in 19 patients with moderately severe congestive failure. In heart failure patients receiving the drug for 4 weeks, cardiac index was increased (p = 0.04) and systemic vascular resistance index was decreased (p = 0.02). Systolic cardiac function was unchanged but isovolumetric relaxation time was decreased significantly, suggesting improvement in diastolic function. Total serum cholesterol (p = 0.005) and triglycerides (p = 0.01) also were decreased significantly. DITPA could represent a useful new agent for treatment of congestive heart failure.\\n- There is emerging evidence that treatment with thyroid hormone (TH) can improve postischemic cardiac function. 3,5-Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a TH analog, has been proposed to be a safer therapeutic agent than TH because of its negligible effects on cardiac metabolism and heart rate. However, conflicting results have been reported for the cardiac effects of DITPA. Importantly, recent clinical trials demonstrated no symptomatic benefit in patients with DITPA despite some improved hemodynamic and metabolic parameters. To address these issues, dose-dependent effects of DITPA were investigated in mice for baseline cardiovascular effects and postischemic myocardial function and/or salvage. Mice were treated with subcutaneous DITPA at 0.937, 1.875, 3.75, or 7.5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) for 7 days, and the results were compared with untreated mice for ex vivo and/or in vivo myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). DITPA had no effects on baseline body temperature, body weight, or heart rate; however, it mildly increased blood pressure. In isolated hearts, baseline contractile function was significantly impaired in DITPA-pretreated mice; however, postischemic recovery was comparable between untreated and DITPA-treated groups. In vivo baseline cardiac parameters were significantly affected by DITPA, with increased ventricular dimensions and decreased contractile function. Importantly, DITPA-treated mice demonstrated high prevalence of fatal cardiac rhythm abnormalities during in vivo ischemia and/or reperfusion. There were no improvements in myocardial infarction and postischemic fractional shortening with DITPA. Myocardial sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and heat shock protein (HSP) levels remained unchanged with DITPA treatment. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R.\\n- In hypothyroid patients, altered microvascular structure and function may affect mood and cognitive function. We hypothesized that adult male hypothyroid rats will have significantly lower forebrain blood vessel densities (BVD) than euthyroid rats and that treatment with 3,5-diiothyroprionic acid (DITPA) (a thyroid hormone analog) or thyroxine (T(4)) will normalize BVDs. The euthyroid group received no thyroidectomy or treatment. The other three groups received thyroidectomies and pellets. The hypothyroid group received a placebo pellet, the DITPA group received an 80-mg DITPA-containing pellet, and the T(4) group received a 5.2-mg T(4) slow-release pellet for 6 wk. Body weights, cardiac function, and body temperatures were measured. A monoclonal antiplatelet endothelial cell adhesion antibody was used to visualize blood vessels. The euthyroid group averaged body weights of 548 +/- 54 g, while the hypothyroid group averaged a body weight of 332 +/- 19 g (P value < 0.001). Relative to the euthyroid group, the DITPA-treated group was significantly lighter (P value < 0.05), while the T(4)-treated group was comparable in body weight to the euthyroid group. The same trends were seen with body temperature and cardiac function with the largest difference between the euthyroid and hypothyroid groups. BVD in the euthyroid group was 147 +/- 12 blood vessels/mm(2) and in hypothyroid group 69 +/- 5 blood vessels/mm(2) (P = 0.013) but similar among the euthyroid, DITPA, and T(4) groups. These results show that hypothyroidism decreased BVD in adult rat forebrain regions. Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD.\\n- We have recently described the proangiogenesis effects of thyroid hormone in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Generation of new blood vessels from existing vessels was promoted 2- to 3-fold by either T(4) or T(3) at 10(-8)-10(-7) M total hormone concentrations. In the present studies, nanomolar concentrations of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotropic properties, exhibited potent proangiogenic activity that was comparable to that obtained with T(3) and T(4) in both the CAM model and in an in vitro three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting assay. The proangiogenesis effect of DITPA was inhibited by tetraiodothyroacetic acid, a thyroid hormone analog that competes with T(4) and T(3) for a novel cell surface hormone receptor site on integrin alphavbeta3. The thyroid hormone analogs DITPA, T(4), and T(4)-agarose, as well as basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, demonstrated comparable proangiogenic effects in the CAM model and in the three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting model. The proangiogenesis effect of either DITPA or b-FGF was blocked by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade. Additionally, a specific integrin alphavbeta3 small molecule antagonist, XT199, effectively inhibited the proangiogenesis effect of DITPA and b-FGF. Thus, the proangiogenesis actions of thyroid hormone and its analog DITPA are initiated at the plasma membrane, apparently at integrin alphavbeta3, and are MAPK dependent.\\n- Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is a thyroid hormone analog that is currently in phase II clinical trials. However, there have not been any studies to comprehensively analyze its effect on myocyte morphology. In addition, long-term studies with DITPA have not been done. This study compares the effects of DITPA with L-thyroxine (T4) on chamber remodeling, cardiac function, cellular morphology, cardiac blood flow, and protein expression. Normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters were treated with T4 or DITPA for 2 months. At the end of the treatment, echos, hemodynamics, coronary blood flow, cell morphology, and protein expression data were collected. Both T4 and DITPA treatment reduced chamber diameter during diastole, suggesting attenuated chamber dilatation in cardiomyopathic hamsters. Wall thickness also tended to increase, which was supported by cell morphology data in which DITPA significantly increased cross-sectional growth of myocytes specifically in the minor dimension, which is oriented transmurally. T4 and DITPA also increased myocardial blood flow both at baseline and after maximal dilation. This suggests there was increased angiogenesis or reduced loss of arterioles. Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply.\\n- Heart failure of diverse causes is associated with abnormalities of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)transport. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the thyroid hormone analogue, 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), prevents abnormal Ca(2+)transport and expression of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to circumflex artery ligation or sham operation, and to DITPA administration (3.75 mg/kg/day) or no treatment in a two-by-two factorial design. After 3 weeks, echo-Doppler and LV hemodynamic measurements were performed. From ventricular tissue, single myocyte shortening and relaxation were determined, and Ca(2+)transport was measured in homogenates and SR-enriched microsomes. Levels of mRNA and protein content were determined for the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) and calsequestrin. The administration of DITPA improved LV contraction and relaxation and improved myocyte shortening in infarcted animals. The improvements in LV and myocyte function were associated with increases in V(max)for SR Ca(2+)transport in both homogenates and microsomes. Also, DITPA prevented the decrease in LV protein density for SERCA2a, PLB and RyR-2 post-infarction, without measurable changes in mRNA levels. The thyroid hormone analogue, DITPA, improves LV, myocyte and SR function in infarcted hearts and prevents the downregulation of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. The specific effects of DITPA on post-infarction SR Ca(2+)transport and the expression of SR proteins make this compound a potentially useful therapeutic agent for LV systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction.\\n- BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone can have positive effects on the cardiovascular system but its therapeutic potential is limited secondary to its adverse effects. DITPA (3,5-diiodothyroproprionic acid) is a synthetic thyroid hormone analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects. DITPA has previously been shown to reduce pathologic remodeling and improve cardiac output following myocardial infarction; however, few studies have examined the role of DITPA in determining infarct size or the early inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia. We examined the role of DITPA in the acute phase following infarction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were subjected to surgical induction of myocardial infarction and were then randomized to receive daily injections of DITPA or vehicle control. After 3 d, animals were sacrificed and infarct size was determined by H and E staining. Myocardial macrophage and neutrophil accumulation was determined by immunofluorescent staining. Immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to examine the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homogenates from the ischemic tissue.RESULTS: Compared with vehicle control, DITPA treated animals had smaller infarcts (52.1%\u00b15.7% versus 37.3%\u00b13.6%, P<0.05) and decreased macrophage (32\u00b14 versus 14\u00b11 cells/HPF, P<0.05, and neutrophil (14\u00b12 versus 7\u00b11 cells/HPF, P<0.05) accumulation. Myocardial ICAM-1, (2.37\u00b10.4 versus 1.1\u00b10.2, P<0.05), KC levels (33.32\u00b112.4 pg/mg, versus 21.24\u00b18.9 pg/mg, P<0.05), and IL-6 levels (112.3\u00b178 pg/mg versus 37.3\u00b125.9 pg/mg, P<0.05) were also reduced in the DITPA treated group, while MCP-1 levels were equivalent between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. The reduction in myocardial ICAM-1, KC, and IL-6 levels in the DITPA group was associated with a decrease in macrophage and neutrophil accumulation.\\n- Thyroid hormones [predominantly 3, 5, 3 -I- iodothyronine (T3)] regulate cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism but cardiac effects restrict their use as hypolipidemic drugs. New molecules have been developped which target specifically the thyroid hormone receptor ss, predominant isoform in liver. The first thyroid hormone agonist, called GC1, has selective actions compared to T3. In animals, GC1 reduced serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides, probably by stimulation important steps in reverse cholesterol transport. Other selective thyromimetic, KB- 2115 and KB - 141 have similar effects. Another class of thyroid hormone analogs, the thyronamines have emerged recently but the basic biology of this new class of endogenous thyroid hormone remains to better understood. Therefore, these molecules may be a potentially treatment for obesity and reduction cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a). To date the studies in human are preliminary. Tolerance and efficacy of these drugs are still under investigation.\\n- The possibility that thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance might be useful in the treatment of heart failure has-been examined. In the rat postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low doses (1.5 micrograms/100 g) of thyroxine (T4) for 3 days produced a positive inotropic response, including an increase in left ventricular (LV) dP/dt and a decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). When treatment with T4 was continued at the same or higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10-12 days, heart rate was increased and improvement in LVEDP was not sustained. To identify an analogue with a more favorable hemodynamic profile, single- and double-ring compounds related to T4 were screened for thyromimetic activity in heart cell cultures and for their ability to bind thyroid hormone receptors. One of the analogues selected, 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), was found to have inotropic selectivity in hypothyroid rats. When administered (375 micrograms/100 g) to rats with ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction in combination with captopril, there was improvement of the resting and stressed cardiac index and LV filling pressure. Similar improvement in cardiac performance was obtained when DITPA was administered to rabbits after infarction. Thus a thyroid hormone analogue with inotropic selectivity may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of heart failure.\\n- We have used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify genes that are affected by congestive heart failure and those influenced by treatment with DITPA and DITPA in combination with captopril using a rat postinfarction model. The most striking result when comparing heart failure to sham operation was that all of the mitochondrial and metabolic enzymes affected were down regulated. When comparing heart failure with DITPA treatment, most of the down regulated metabolic genes were returned toward normal. When comparing heart failure with heart failure animals treated with DITPA and captopril, metabolic enzymes were no longer significantly downregulated. DITPA treatment and the combination of DITPA and captopril show that the metabolic enzymes were no longer down regulated. This represents a substantial improvement in the energy- generating capacity of the heart. These results indicate that the actions of DITPA and the combination of DITPA and captopril in heart failure can be partially explained by differences in gene activation.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nIs DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies\\n\\nTask:\\n 1.

Excess thyroid hormone is, however, associated with unwanted effects on the heart, bone and skeletal muscle. We therefore need analogs that harness the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone without the untoward effects. Such work is largely based on understanding the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, specifically the crystal structure of the nuclear receptor proteins. In clinical studies, use of naturally occurring thyroid hormone analogs can suppress TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer without producing tachycardia. Many thyromimetic compounds have been tested in animal models and shown to increase total body oxygen consumption, and to lower weight and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels while having minor effects on heart rate. Alternatively, analogs that specifically enhance both systolic and diastolic function are potentially useful in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. In addition to analogs that are thyroid hormone receptor agonists, several compounds that are thyroid hormone receptor antagonists have been identified and tested. This Review discusses the potential application of thyroid hormone analogs (both agonists and antagonists) in a variety of human disease states.", "Previous studies have established that reductions in repolarizing currents occur in heart disease and can contribute to life-threatening arrhythmias in myocardium. In this study, we investigated whether the thyroid hormone analog 3, 5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) could restore repolarizing transient outward K(+) current (I(to)) density and gene expression in rat myocardium after myocardial infarction (MI). Our findings show that I(to) density was reduced after MI (14.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 10.2 +/- 0.9 pA/pF, sham vs. post-MI at +40 mV). mRNA levels of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 genes were decreased but Kv1.4 mRNA levels were increased post-MI. Corresponding changes in Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 protein were also observed. Chronic treatment of post-MI rats with 10 mg/kg DITPA restored I(to) density (to 15.2 +/- 1.1 pA/pF at +40 mV) as well as Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 expression to levels observed in sham-operated controls. Other membrane currents (Na(+), L-type Ca(2+), sustained, and inward rectifier K(+) currents) were unaffected by DITPA treatment. Associated with the changes in I(to) expression, action potential durations (current-clamp recordings in isolated single right ventricular myocytes and monophasic action potential recordings from the right free wall in situ) were prolonged after MI and restored with DITPA treatment. Our results demonstrate that DITPA restores I(to) density in the setting of MI, which may be useful in preventing complications associated with I(to) downregulation.", "The patent application WO2008106213 describes the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone analogue 3,5 diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) such as stimulating weight loss in overweight mammals, lowering of triglyceride and treating metabolic syndrome in humans. The human population of the patients selected in the studies mentioned has a body mass index > 25. Two examples of the human clinical studies employing DITPA have been mentioned, namely, the body weight reduction and improvement in metabolic abnormalities in obese adults.", "CONTEXT: Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a thyroid hormone-specific cell membrane transporter. MCT8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid tests. The great majority of affected children cannot walk or talk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue hypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone is ineffective. In Mct8-deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT8 to enter tissues and could be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect and efficacy of DITPA in children with MCT8 deficiency.METHODS: This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on compassionate grounds for 26-40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8.5-25 months, beginning with a small dose of 1.8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg/d (2.1-2.4 mg/kg \u00b7 d), given in three divided doses.RESULTS: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg \u00b7 d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The following significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all subjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). Cholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain occurred in two. None of the treated children required a gastric feeding tube or developed seizures. No adverse effects were observed.CONCLUSION: DITPA (1-2 mg/kg \u00b7 d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and reduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss. The effects of earlier commencement and long-term therapy remain to be determined.", "To determine the biochemical and related functional effects of the thyroid analog diiodothyroproprionic acid (DITPA) on primate myocardium, we examined, both before and after 23 days of DITPA (3.75 mg/kg): myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoforms and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium cycling proteins; left ventricular (LV) function; and the LV force-frequency relation in four baboons chronically instrumented with sonomicrometers and micromanometers. The force-frequency relation was measured as the response of isovolumic contraction (dP/dtmax) to incremental pacing and the critical heart rate (HRcrit) as the rate at which dP/dtmax reached its maximum. DITPA increased basal LV dPt/dtmax (3,300 +/- 378 versus 2,943 +/- 413 mm Hg/sec; p = .09), and velocity of circumferential shortening (1.13 +/- 0.30 versus 0.76 +/- 0.30 circ/sec; p < .01), decreased the basal time constant of isovolumic relaxation (24.2 +/- 1.6 versus 29.9 +/- 2.5 msec; p < .05), and increased the HRcrit (203 +/- 19 versus 168 +/- 20 bpm; p < .05), without effecting significant changes in either basal heart rate (119 +/- 14 versus 111 +/- 17 bpm) or systolic blood pressure (137 +/- 14 versus 126 +/- 8 mm Hg). Quantitative immunoblotting revealed significant decreases in both phospholamban and the ratio of phospholamban to SR Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase in DITPA-treated animals when compared to four untreated controls. By contrast, alpha-MHC isoform was undetectable in both DITPA treated and control baboons. Thus, DITPA favorably alters the stoichiometry between the SR calcium pump and its inhibitor, phospholamban, and has positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the normal primate left ventricle, which may be useful in the treatment of heart failure. Unlike thyroid hormone, these changes occur in the absence of detectable alpha-MHC isoform protein expression and without an increase in heart rate.", "Patients with hypothyroidism are at a higher risk for coronary vascular disease. Patients with diabetes and related vascular complications also have an increased incidence of low thyroid function. While thyroid hormones (THs) may be key regulators of a healthy vasculature, potential undesirable side effects hinder their use in the treatment of vascular disorders. TH analogs such as 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) may provide a safer treatment option. However, the relative potency of DITPA on vascular growth, cardiac function, and metabolism is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the vascular growth-promoting effects of DITPA can be obtained with a minimum effect on cardiac function. Thyroidectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were given slow-release pellets with either thyroxine (T4, 2.7 or 5.2 mg) or DITPA (80 mg) for 6 wk and were compared with placebo. Heart mass, body mass, body temperature, serum THs, cardiac function (echocardiograms and hemodynamics), and myocardial arteriolar density were determined. Hypothyroidism led to reductions in cardiac function, heart mass, body temperature, and myocardial arterioles. High-dose T4 prevented arteriolar loss and the development of hypothyroidism. Low-dose T4 partially prevented the reduction in cardiac function but had minimal effects on arteriolar loss. In contrast, DITPA treatment prevented myocardial arteriolar loss but not the progression of hypothyroid-induced changes in cardiac function. The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects. Drugs in this class may provide new therapeutic options for patients with vascular disease.", "In view of the evidence that thyroid hormone administration has angiogenic effects on the hypertrophic myocardium, we tested the hypothesis that the capillary supply in the hypertrophic myocardium surviving infarction would be improved by administration of the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyroproprionic acid (DITPA). We administered DITPA (MI-DITPA) or saline (MI-saline), s.c., to rats for 10 days following experimental infarction of the left ventricle (LV). Morphometric methods were used to assess capillarity and myocyte cross-sectional area in three regions of the left ventricle: (1) border (next to the scar of infarction); (2) adjacent (next to the border); and (3) remote (interventricular septum). Infarct size ranged from 20-85% of the LV free-wall, and both groups had similar mean infarct size. Capillary length density (LV) was significantly higher in the remote region of the treated group than in the MI-saline rats. LV in the border region, which experienced the most marked increase in cardiocyte cross-sectional area, was not significantly lower than in the other regions, indicating a more marked angiogenic response. In hearts with large infarcts (> or = 40%) LV in the border region was higher in the DITPA group than in the non-treated rats. In the MI-DITPA group, cardiocyte size in the border region was positively correlated with that of the other regions, which contrasts with the negative correlations noted for the MI-saline rats. These data suggest that DITPA therapy (1) may improve maximal perfusion potential of the hypertrophied myocardium surviving a myocardial infarction, and (2) is selectively effective in the border region of hearts with large infarcts.", "The heart is an important target of thyroid hormone actions. Only a limited number of cardiac target genes have been identified, and little is known about their regulation by T(3) (3,3',5-triiodothyronine) and thyroid hormone analogs. We used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify novel cardiac genes regulated by T(3) and two thyroid hormone analogs, 3,5-diidodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and CGS 23425 [N-[3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroxy-3'-isopropylphenoxy)-phenyl]-oxamic acid]. DITPA binds with lower affinity than T(3) to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 and beta1 isoforms, whereas CGS 23425 binds selectively to beta1. Fluorescent-labeled cDNA was prepared from cultured heart cells maintained in medium stripped of thyroid hormone (\"hypothyroid\" control) or treated with T(3), DITPA, and CGS 23425 at concentrations 5 times their respective K(d) values for 48 h. The arrays were scanned and analyzed using an analysis of variance program. Sixty-four genes were identified that were >1.5 times up- or down-regulated by one of the treatments with P < 0.05. The genes regulated by T(3) and DITPA were nearly identical. Thirteen genes were differentially regulated by CGS 23425. Genes encoding contractile proteins, Ca(2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and several proteins of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, were up-regulated by T(3) and DITPA but not by CGS 23425. These results indicate that some, but not all, of the actions of thyroid hormone analogs can be explained by differences in gene activation.", "CONTEXT: Widespread thyroid hormone actions offer the possibility of developing selective thyromimetic analogs with salutary metabolic properties. Consequently, effects of diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers were studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-wk trial, which was primarily designed to assess treatment of stable chronic heart failure.DESIGN: Eighty-six patients (aged 66 +/- 11 yr, mean +/- sd) were randomized (1:2) to placebo or an escalating DITPA dose (90 to 180, 270, and 360 mg/d) over 8 wk until serum TSH was less than 0.02 mU/liter. Patients were studied at 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 wk and after 4 wk off study drug. Only 21 DITPA-treated and 27 placebo patients completed the full 24 wk of therapy.RESULTS: DITPA therapy lowered serum TSH levels and, to a lesser extent, serum T(3) and T(4), but there were no differences in clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels both decreased on DITPA; there was a transient decrease in triglycerides and no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. DITPA therapy was associated with significant reduction in body weight, 12.5 lb at 24 wk. Increases in serum osteocalcin, N-telopeptide, and deoxypyridinoline levels were consistent with increased bone turnover on DITPA.CONCLUSION: This investigation of DITPA actions demonstrated its efficacy in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, DITPA's adverse effects at doses used resulted in a high dropout rate and potentially dangerous skeletal actions were observed.", "After an initial safety study in 7 normal volunteers, a randomized double-blind comparison was made between 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and placebo in 19 patients with moderately severe congestive failure. In heart failure patients receiving the drug for 4 weeks, cardiac index was increased (p = 0.04) and systemic vascular resistance index was decreased (p = 0.02). Systolic cardiac function was unchanged but isovolumetric relaxation time was decreased significantly, suggesting improvement in diastolic function. Total serum cholesterol (p = 0.005) and triglycerides (p = 0.01) also were decreased significantly. DITPA could represent a useful new agent for treatment of congestive heart failure.", "There is emerging evidence that treatment with thyroid hormone (TH) can improve postischemic cardiac function. 3,5-Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a TH analog, has been proposed to be a safer therapeutic agent than TH because of its negligible effects on cardiac metabolism and heart rate. However, conflicting results have been reported for the cardiac effects of DITPA. Importantly, recent clinical trials demonstrated no symptomatic benefit in patients with DITPA despite some improved hemodynamic and metabolic parameters. To address these issues, dose-dependent effects of DITPA were investigated in mice for baseline cardiovascular effects and postischemic myocardial function and/or salvage. Mice were treated with subcutaneous DITPA at 0.937, 1.875, 3.75, or 7.5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) for 7 days, and the results were compared with untreated mice for ex vivo and/or in vivo myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). DITPA had no effects on baseline body temperature, body weight, or heart rate; however, it mildly increased blood pressure. In isolated hearts, baseline contractile function was significantly impaired in DITPA-pretreated mice; however, postischemic recovery was comparable between untreated and DITPA-treated groups. In vivo baseline cardiac parameters were significantly affected by DITPA, with increased ventricular dimensions and decreased contractile function. Importantly, DITPA-treated mice demonstrated high prevalence of fatal cardiac rhythm abnormalities during in vivo ischemia and/or reperfusion. There were no improvements in myocardial infarction and postischemic fractional shortening with DITPA. Myocardial sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and heat shock protein (HSP) levels remained unchanged with DITPA treatment. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R.", "In hypothyroid patients, altered microvascular structure and function may affect mood and cognitive function. We hypothesized that adult male hypothyroid rats will have significantly lower forebrain blood vessel densities (BVD) than euthyroid rats and that treatment with 3,5-diiothyroprionic acid (DITPA) (a thyroid hormone analog) or thyroxine (T(4)) will normalize BVDs. The euthyroid group received no thyroidectomy or treatment. The other three groups received thyroidectomies and pellets. The hypothyroid group received a placebo pellet, the DITPA group received an 80-mg DITPA-containing pellet, and the T(4) group received a 5.2-mg T(4) slow-release pellet for 6 wk. Body weights, cardiac function, and body temperatures were measured. A monoclonal antiplatelet endothelial cell adhesion antibody was used to visualize blood vessels. The euthyroid group averaged body weights of 548 +/- 54 g, while the hypothyroid group averaged a body weight of 332 +/- 19 g (P value < 0.001). Relative to the euthyroid group, the DITPA-treated group was significantly lighter (P value < 0.05), while the T(4)-treated group was comparable in body weight to the euthyroid group. The same trends were seen with body temperature and cardiac function with the largest difference between the euthyroid and hypothyroid groups. BVD in the euthyroid group was 147 +/- 12 blood vessels/mm(2) and in hypothyroid group 69 +/- 5 blood vessels/mm(2) (P = 0.013) but similar among the euthyroid, DITPA, and T(4) groups. These results show that hypothyroidism decreased BVD in adult rat forebrain regions. Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD.", "We have recently described the proangiogenesis effects of thyroid hormone in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Generation of new blood vessels from existing vessels was promoted 2- to 3-fold by either T(4) or T(3) at 10(-8)-10(-7) M total hormone concentrations. In the present studies, nanomolar concentrations of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotropic properties, exhibited potent proangiogenic activity that was comparable to that obtained with T(3) and T(4) in both the CAM model and in an in vitro three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting assay. The proangiogenesis effect of DITPA was inhibited by tetraiodothyroacetic acid, a thyroid hormone analog that competes with T(4) and T(3) for a novel cell surface hormone receptor site on integrin alphavbeta3. The thyroid hormone analogs DITPA, T(4), and T(4)-agarose, as well as basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, demonstrated comparable proangiogenic effects in the CAM model and in the three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting model. The proangiogenesis effect of either DITPA or b-FGF was blocked by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade. Additionally, a specific integrin alphavbeta3 small molecule antagonist, XT199, effectively inhibited the proangiogenesis effect of DITPA and b-FGF. Thus, the proangiogenesis actions of thyroid hormone and its analog DITPA are initiated at the plasma membrane, apparently at integrin alphavbeta3, and are MAPK dependent.", "Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is a thyroid hormone analog that is currently in phase II clinical trials. However, there have not been any studies to comprehensively analyze its effect on myocyte morphology. In addition, long-term studies with DITPA have not been done. This study compares the effects of DITPA with L-thyroxine (T4) on chamber remodeling, cardiac function, cellular morphology, cardiac blood flow, and protein expression. Normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters were treated with T4 or DITPA for 2 months. At the end of the treatment, echos, hemodynamics, coronary blood flow, cell morphology, and protein expression data were collected. Both T4 and DITPA treatment reduced chamber diameter during diastole, suggesting attenuated chamber dilatation in cardiomyopathic hamsters. Wall thickness also tended to increase, which was supported by cell morphology data in which DITPA significantly increased cross-sectional growth of myocytes specifically in the minor dimension, which is oriented transmurally. T4 and DITPA also increased myocardial blood flow both at baseline and after maximal dilation. This suggests there was increased angiogenesis or reduced loss of arterioles. Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply.", "Heart failure of diverse causes is associated with abnormalities of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)transport. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the thyroid hormone analogue, 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), prevents abnormal Ca(2+)transport and expression of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to circumflex artery ligation or sham operation, and to DITPA administration (3.75 mg/kg/day) or no treatment in a two-by-two factorial design. After 3 weeks, echo-Doppler and LV hemodynamic measurements were performed. From ventricular tissue, single myocyte shortening and relaxation were determined, and Ca(2+)transport was measured in homogenates and SR-enriched microsomes. Levels of mRNA and protein content were determined for the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) and calsequestrin. The administration of DITPA improved LV contraction and relaxation and improved myocyte shortening in infarcted animals. The improvements in LV and myocyte function were associated with increases in V(max)for SR Ca(2+)transport in both homogenates and microsomes. Also, DITPA prevented the decrease in LV protein density for SERCA2a, PLB and RyR-2 post-infarction, without measurable changes in mRNA levels. The thyroid hormone analogue, DITPA, improves LV, myocyte and SR function in infarcted hearts and prevents the downregulation of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. The specific effects of DITPA on post-infarction SR Ca(2+)transport and the expression of SR proteins make this compound a potentially useful therapeutic agent for LV systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction.", "BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone can have positive effects on the cardiovascular system but its therapeutic potential is limited secondary to its adverse effects. DITPA (3,5-diiodothyroproprionic acid) is a synthetic thyroid hormone analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects. DITPA has previously been shown to reduce pathologic remodeling and improve cardiac output following myocardial infarction; however, few studies have examined the role of DITPA in determining infarct size or the early inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia. We examined the role of DITPA in the acute phase following infarction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were subjected to surgical induction of myocardial infarction and were then randomized to receive daily injections of DITPA or vehicle control. After 3 d, animals were sacrificed and infarct size was determined by H and E staining. Myocardial macrophage and neutrophil accumulation was determined by immunofluorescent staining. Immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to examine the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homogenates from the ischemic tissue.RESULTS: Compared with vehicle control, DITPA treated animals had smaller infarcts (52.1%\u00b15.7% versus 37.3%\u00b13.6%, P<0.05) and decreased macrophage (32\u00b14 versus 14\u00b11 cells/HPF, P<0.05, and neutrophil (14\u00b12 versus 7\u00b11 cells/HPF, P<0.05) accumulation. Myocardial ICAM-1, (2.37\u00b10.4 versus 1.1\u00b10.2, P<0.05), KC levels (33.32\u00b112.4 pg/mg, versus 21.24\u00b18.9 pg/mg, P<0.05), and IL-6 levels (112.3\u00b178 pg/mg versus 37.3\u00b125.9 pg/mg, P<0.05) were also reduced in the DITPA treated group, while MCP-1 levels were equivalent between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. The reduction in myocardial ICAM-1, KC, and IL-6 levels in the DITPA group was associated with a decrease in macrophage and neutrophil accumulation.", "Thyroid hormones [predominantly 3, 5, 3 -I- iodothyronine (T3)] regulate cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism but cardiac effects restrict their use as hypolipidemic drugs. New molecules have been developped which target specifically the thyroid hormone receptor ss, predominant isoform in liver. The first thyroid hormone agonist, called GC1, has selective actions compared to T3. In animals, GC1 reduced serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides, probably by stimulation important steps in reverse cholesterol transport. Other selective thyromimetic, KB- 2115 and KB - 141 have similar effects. Another class of thyroid hormone analogs, the thyronamines have emerged recently but the basic biology of this new class of endogenous thyroid hormone remains to better understood. Therefore, these molecules may be a potentially treatment for obesity and reduction cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a). To date the studies in human are preliminary. Tolerance and efficacy of these drugs are still under investigation.", "The possibility that thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance might be useful in the treatment of heart failure has-been examined. In the rat postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low doses (1.5 micrograms/100 g) of thyroxine (T4) for 3 days produced a positive inotropic response, including an increase in left ventricular (LV) dP/dt and a decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). When treatment with T4 was continued at the same or higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10-12 days, heart rate was increased and improvement in LVEDP was not sustained. To identify an analogue with a more favorable hemodynamic profile, single- and double-ring compounds related to T4 were screened for thyromimetic activity in heart cell cultures and for their ability to bind thyroid hormone receptors. One of the analogues selected, 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), was found to have inotropic selectivity in hypothyroid rats. When administered (375 micrograms/100 g) to rats with ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction in combination with captopril, there was improvement of the resting and stressed cardiac index and LV filling pressure. Similar improvement in cardiac performance was obtained when DITPA was administered to rabbits after infarction. Thus a thyroid hormone analogue with inotropic selectivity may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of heart failure.", "We have used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify genes that are affected by congestive heart failure and those influenced by treatment with DITPA and DITPA in combination with captopril using a rat postinfarction model. The most striking result when comparing heart failure to sham operation was that all of the mitochondrial and metabolic enzymes affected were down regulated. When comparing heart failure with DITPA treatment, most of the down regulated metabolic genes were returned toward normal. When comparing heart failure with heart failure animals treated with DITPA and captopril, metabolic enzymes were no longer significantly downregulated. DITPA treatment and the combination of DITPA and captopril show that the metabolic enzymes were no longer down regulated. This represents a substantial improvement in the energy- generating capacity of the heart. These results indicate that the actions of DITPA and the combination of DITPA and captopril in heart failure can be partially explained by differences in gene activation."]}
