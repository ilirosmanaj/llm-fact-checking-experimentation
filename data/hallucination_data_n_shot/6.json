Blood samples were drawn to assess renal function, and Na+, hemoglobin, NT-proBNPs, fT3, fT4 and TSH levels. Patients with hyperthyroidism were excluded.RESULTS: During the follow-up (15+/-8 months), heart failure progression was observed in 79 patients (including 18 who died of heart failure after hospitalisation and six who underwent transplantation). Univariate regression analysis showed that TSH (p<0.0001), fT3 (p<0.0001), fT4 (p=0.016) and fT3/fT4 (p<0.0001) were associated with heart failure progression but multivariate analysis showed that only TSH considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.001) as well as subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH &gt 5.5 mUI/l; p=0.014) remained significantly associated with the events.CONCLUSIONS: In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression. This supports the need for prospective studies aimed at clarifying the most appropriate therapeutic approach to sub-clinical hypothyroidism in such patients.\\n- Although low levels of free triiodothyronine and high levels of brain natriuretic peptide have been shown as independent predictors of death in chronic heart failure patients, few studies have compared their prognostic values. The aim of this prospective study was to measure free triiodothyronine and brain natriuretic peptide levels and to compare their prognostic values among such patients.A total of 334 patients (mean age, 62 \u00b1 13 yr; 218 men) with ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy were included in the study. The primary endpoint was a major cardiac event.During the follow-up period, 92 patients (28%) experienced a major cardiac event. Mean free triiodothyronine levels were lower and median brain natriuretic peptide levels were higher in patients with major cardiac events than in those without. A significant negative correlation was found between free triiodothyronine and brain natriuretic peptide levels. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the predictive cutoff values were < 2.12 pg/mL for free triiodothyronine and > 686 pg/mL for brain natriuretic peptide. Cumulative survival was significantly lower among patients with free triiodothyronine < 2.12 pg/mL and among patients with brain natriuretic peptide > 686 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, the significant independent predictors of major cardiac events were age, free triiodothyronine, and brain natriuretic peptide.In the present study, free triiodothyronine and brain natriuretic peptide had similar prognostic values for predicting long-term prognosis in chronic heart failure patients. These results also suggested that combining these biomarkers may provide an important risk indicator for patients with heart failure.\\n- OBJECTIVE: Previous experimental studies have provided evidence showing that changes in thyroid hormone signaling correspond to alterations in myocardial function in animal models of heart failure. The present study further explores whether thyroid hormone alterations are correlated with the functional status of the myocardium in patients with heart failure.METHODS: In this study, 37 patients with mean ejection fraction (EF%) of 26.2 (8.2) were included. Myocardial performance was assessed by echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Total tri-iodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and TSH levels were measured in plasma.RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004), systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood pressure.CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and confirm previous experimental reports.\\n- Thyroid hormone directly affects the heart and peripheral vascular system. The hormone can increase myocardial inotropy and heart rate and dilate peripheral arteries to increase cardiac output. An excessive deficiency of thyroid hormone can cause cardiovascular disease and aggravate many preexisting conditions. In severe systemic illness and after major surgical procedures changes in thyroid function can occur, leading to the \"euthyroid sick syndrome.\" Patients will have normal or decreased levels of T4, decreased free and total T3, and usually normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone. This syndrome may be an adaptive response to systemic illness that usually will revert to normal without hormone supplementation as the illness subsides. Recently, however, many investigators have explored the benefits of thyroid hormone supplementation in those diseases associated with euthyroid sick syndrome. Thyroid hormone\\'s effects on the cardiovascular system make it an attractive therapy for those patients with impaired hemodynamics and low T3. Thyroid hormone has also been considered a treatment for patients with congestive heart failure, for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and heart transplantation, and for patients with hyperlipidemia. At present there is no evidence suggesting a favorable treatment outcome using thyroid hormone supplementation for any systemic condition except in those patients with documented hypothyroidism.\\n- BACKGROUND: Changes in peripheral thyroid hormone concentration and metabolism can occur in euthyroid patients suffering from severe non-thyroidal illnesses. Recently, sick euthyroid syndrome has been reported in patients suffering from advanced heart failure.AIM: This study was to evaluate prospectively the presence and pathophysiological implications of sick euthyroid syndrome in moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure patients.METHODS: The study population were 199 chronic heart failure patients admitted over a 2-year period to our heart failure unit for assessment of cardiac transplantation. They were closely followed up with clinical and instrumental examinations (including clinical, hormonal, nutritional and cardiac function evaluations). Sick euthyroid syndrome was defined as a serum total triiodothyronine value of less than the lowest normal limit (< 1.23 nmol.l-1) in the presence of a normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration.RESULTS: Sick euthyroid syndrome was found in 36/199 patients (18%). According to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of severity of heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome patients appear in higher NYHA classes (31% of classes III and IV, vs 7% of class I and II). Such patients also weigh less and are more frequently malnourished. Alterations in cardiac index, ventricular filling pressures, functional impairment, and the liver function parameters, were more significant in sick euthyroid syndrome than in non-sick euthyroid syndrome patients. Serum norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic factor were significantly higher, and insulin significantly lower in the sick euthyroid syndrome group. During follow-up, deaths were significantly more frequent in sick euthyroid syndrome patients (13/27, 48%) than in non-sick euthyroid syndrome (30/141, 21%; P < 0.005). In six sick euthyroid syndrome patients who underwent heart transplantation, mean total triiodothyronine values increased from 0.9 +/- 0.1 before to 1.96 +/- 0.3 nmol.l(-1)post-transplantation (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In a large and representative population of patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome shows a prevalence of 18%. Its occurrence was related to the degree of functional cardiac impairment, but was not an independent negative prognostic factor. Preliminary results indicate that heart transplantation is associated with reversibility of sick euthyroid syndrome.\\n- BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in thyroid function are frequent in patients with heart failure and are associated with increased mortality. However, the relation between thyroid hormone levels and echocardiographic parameters has not been investigated sufficiently.AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlations of thyroid hormone levels with echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate their associations with subsequent mortality in a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP).METHODS: Serum levels of thyroid hormones were measured in 111 consecutive patients with DCMP (35 female, 76 male, mean age: 62+/-12 years). All patients underwent echocardiographic examination and were followed-up for a period of 12+/-8 months.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (21%) had abnormalities in thyroid function tests. Free triiodothyronine (fT3)/free thyroxine (fT4) ratio was significantly correlated with most of echocardiographic parameters, such as chamber diameters and ejection fraction. Sixteen patients (14%) died during the follow-up period; their fT3/fT4 ratio was significantly lower than the patients who survived (1.31+/-0.37 vs. 2.01+/-0.72, p<0.001). A fT3/fT4 ratio of <or=1.7 was associated with an increased risk of mortality (p<0.001), independent of other prognostic markers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictivity of fT3/fT4 ratio <or=1.7 for cardiac mortality were 100%, 71%, 36% and 100%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Determination of FT3/FT4 ratio may be a valuable and simple predictor for identification of patients with DCMP who are at high risk of subsequent mortality.\\n- Thyroid hormones have relevant activity at cardiac and vascular level, by influencing heart rate, myocardial excitability as well as inotropic and lusitropic status, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Moreover, they interact with neuro-hormonal systems such as sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system thus also indirectly influencing cardiovascular function. Due to these effects, both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, either in their overt or subclinical forms, can have an unfavourable impact in the setting of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this review is to focus on the prognostic consequences of thyroid disorders in heart failure patients. Moreover, the therapeutical approach and the possible beneficial effects of restoring euthyroidism are reviewed.\\n- Thyroid (dys)function in heart failure: is it a potential target for medical treatment?\\n- Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function. Clinical studies have shown that mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, both primary (subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism) and secondary (low T(3) syndrome) have negative prognostic impact in patients with heart failure. In these patients, the administration of synthetic triiodothyronine (T(3)) was well tolerated and induced significant improvement in cardiac function without increased heart rate and metabolic demand. Large multicenter, placebo-controlled prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the safety and prognostic effects of chronic treatment with TH replacement therapy in patients with heart failure. The article also discusses recent patents in this field.\\n- OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and serum triiodothyronine (T3) in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).METHODS: 156 cases of CHF patients and 75 cases of cardiac function I patients hospitalized over the same period were utilized in this study. On admission, the patient\\'s BNP and T3 plasma concentrations were measured. The correlation analysis of plasma BNP and T3 in CHF patients with cardiac function classification was conducted.RESULTS: According to the NYHA grading systems, the plasma BNP levels in patients with II, III, and IV grade CHF were significantly higher than those with cardiac function I (P < 0.05); BNP levels and NYHA grading of cardiac function correlated positively. The BNP concentrations increased with CHF progression (P < 0.01). The T3 level and NYHA grading of cardiac function correlated negatively.TheT3 level decreased as the degree of heart failure increased. Using CHF in combination with BNP to predict the occurrence of CHF had a sensitivity value of 90.8% with 95.5% specificity, 86.3% accuracy, and a negative predictive value of 87.7%.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BNP was more sensitive than T3 in the diagnosis of CHF. The T3 was more meaningful than the BNP in the prognosis of CHF. The BNP and T3 combination detection was more valuable in determining the severity of CHF and prognosis.\\n- Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism.\\n- BACKGROUND: Both low free triiodothyronine (fT3) and high brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) have been separately described as prognostic predictors for mortality in heart failure (HF). We investigated whether their prognostic value is independent.METHODS AND RESULTS: From January of 2001 to December of 2006, we prospectively evaluated 442 consecutive patients with systolic HF and no thyroid disease or treatment with drugs affecting thyroid function (age 65+/-12 years, mean +/- standard deviation, 75% were male, left ventricular ejection fraction 33% +/- 10%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and II: 63%, NYHA class III and IV: 37%). All patients underwent full clinical and echocardiographic evaluation and assessment of BNP and thyroid function. Both cardiac and all-cause mortality (cumulative) were considered as end points. During a median 36-month follow-up (range 1-86 months), 110 patients (24.8%) died, 64 (14.4%) of cardiac causes. Univariate Cox model predictors of all-cause mortality and cardiac death were age, body mass index, creatinine, hemoglobin, ejection fraction, NYHA class, BNP, fT3, and thyroxine level. Multivariate analysis selected age, NYHA class, hemoglobin, BNP, and fT3 as independent predictors for all-cause mortality and NYHA class, BNP, and fT3 as independent predictors for cardiac mortality. Patients with low fT3 and higher BNP showed the highest risk of all-cause and cardiac death (odds ratio 11.6, confidence interval, 5.8-22.9; odds ratio 13.8, confidence interval, 5.4-35.2, respectively, compared with patients with normal fT3 and low BNP).CONCLUSION: fT3 and BNP hold an independent and additive prognostic value in HF.\\n- Thyroid hormones have many effects on the heart and vascular system. Although cardiac output is reduced in hypothyroidism, heart failure is relatively rare because there is a lower demand for peripheral oxygen delivery. Hypothyroidism may also result in accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. We report the case of a 55-year-old man with severe heart failure associated with severe longstanding untreated hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain. On presentation, signs and symptoms of severe hypothyroidism and heart failure were noticed. The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and ischemia. Thyroid stimulating hormone was extremely elevated and thyroid hormone levels were undetectable. A cardiac ultrasonography exam revealed abnormalities of the left ventricular dimensions and function consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed severe multivessel disease. Coronary by-pass was deemed necessary, but surgery was postponed because of severe heart failure. After an increasingly downhill clinical course, the patient died, eight month after his initial presentation, owing to severe heart failure. This patient represents an example of an overlooked diagnosis of severe hypothyroidism, rarely encountered nowadays, leading to dramatic consequences.\\n- The derangement of neuro-endocrine control of circulation influences both disease evolution and response to treatment in patients with heart failure, but little data are available about the complex relationships between the degree of neuro-hormonal activation and clinical severity. We studied the relationships between cardiac natriuretic hormones (CNHs) and several neuro-hormones and immunological markers in a prospective cohort of 105 consecutive patients with cardiomyopathy (77 men and 28 women, mean age 66.7+/-12.4 years, range 33-89 years). We assayed the circulating levels of CNHs (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)), plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, thyroid hormones and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The concentrations of all CNHs and neurohormones were higher in patients with heart failure compared to normal subjects, except for free triiodothyronine (FT3), which was below normal values. ANP was positively related to NYHA class, IL-6, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, while negatively with ejection fraction and FT3. BNP was positively related to age, NYHA class, IL-6, TNF-alpha, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, while negatively with ejection fraction and FT3. A stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that plasma ANP depended only on ejection fraction, adrenaline and noradrenaline values, while for plasma BNP variation NYHA class contributed too. Our data confirm a progressive activation of hormonal and immunological systems in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, CNH circulating levels in heart failure are affected not only by cardiac function and disease severity, but also by activation of neuro-hormonal and stress-related cytokine systems, as well as by the thyroid hormones, even on usual medical treatment.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is the prognostic role of thyroid hormone in patients with heart failure?\\n\\nTask:\\n 1.

At present there is no evidence suggesting a favorable treatment outcome using thyroid hormone supplementation for any systemic condition except in those patients with documented hypothyroidism.", "BACKGROUND: Changes in peripheral thyroid hormone concentration and metabolism can occur in euthyroid patients suffering from severe non-thyroidal illnesses. Recently, sick euthyroid syndrome has been reported in patients suffering from advanced heart failure.AIM: This study was to evaluate prospectively the presence and pathophysiological implications of sick euthyroid syndrome in moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure patients.METHODS: The study population were 199 chronic heart failure patients admitted over a 2-year period to our heart failure unit for assessment of cardiac transplantation. They were closely followed up with clinical and instrumental examinations (including clinical, hormonal, nutritional and cardiac function evaluations). Sick euthyroid syndrome was defined as a serum total triiodothyronine value of less than the lowest normal limit (< 1.23 nmol.l-1) in the presence of a normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration.RESULTS: Sick euthyroid syndrome was found in 36/199 patients (18%). According to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of severity of heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome patients appear in higher NYHA classes (31% of classes III and IV, vs 7% of class I and II). Such patients also weigh less and are more frequently malnourished. Alterations in cardiac index, ventricular filling pressures, functional impairment, and the liver function parameters, were more significant in sick euthyroid syndrome than in non-sick euthyroid syndrome patients. Serum norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic factor were significantly higher, and insulin significantly lower in the sick euthyroid syndrome group. During follow-up, deaths were significantly more frequent in sick euthyroid syndrome patients (13/27, 48%) than in non-sick euthyroid syndrome (30/141, 21%; P < 0.005). In six sick euthyroid syndrome patients who underwent heart transplantation, mean total triiodothyronine values increased from 0.9 +/- 0.1 before to 1.96 +/- 0.3 nmol.l(-1)post-transplantation (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In a large and representative population of patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome shows a prevalence of 18%. Its occurrence was related to the degree of functional cardiac impairment, but was not an independent negative prognostic factor. Preliminary results indicate that heart transplantation is associated with reversibility of sick euthyroid syndrome.", "BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in thyroid function are frequent in patients with heart failure and are associated with increased mortality. However, the relation between thyroid hormone levels and echocardiographic parameters has not been investigated sufficiently.AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlations of thyroid hormone levels with echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate their associations with subsequent mortality in a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP).METHODS: Serum levels of thyroid hormones were measured in 111 consecutive patients with DCMP (35 female, 76 male, mean age: 62+/-12 years). All patients underwent echocardiographic examination and were followed-up for a period of 12+/-8 months.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (21%) had abnormalities in thyroid function tests. Free triiodothyronine (fT3)/free thyroxine (fT4) ratio was significantly correlated with most of echocardiographic parameters, such as chamber diameters and ejection fraction. Sixteen patients (14%) died during the follow-up period; their fT3/fT4 ratio was significantly lower than the patients who survived (1.31+/-0.37 vs. 2.01+/-0.72, p<0.001). A fT3/fT4 ratio of <or=1.7 was associated with an increased risk of mortality (p<0.001), independent of other prognostic markers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictivity of fT3/fT4 ratio <or=1.7 for cardiac mortality were 100%, 71%, 36% and 100%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Determination of FT3/FT4 ratio may be a valuable and simple predictor for identification of patients with DCMP who are at high risk of subsequent mortality.", "Thyroid hormones have relevant activity at cardiac and vascular level, by influencing heart rate, myocardial excitability as well as inotropic and lusitropic status, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Moreover, they interact with neuro-hormonal systems such as sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system thus also indirectly influencing cardiovascular function. Due to these effects, both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, either in their overt or subclinical forms, can have an unfavourable impact in the setting of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this review is to focus on the prognostic consequences of thyroid disorders in heart failure patients. Moreover, the therapeutical approach and the possible beneficial effects of restoring euthyroidism are reviewed.", "Thyroid (dys)function in heart failure: is it a potential target for medical treatment?", "Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function. Clinical studies have shown that mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, both primary (subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism) and secondary (low T(3) syndrome) have negative prognostic impact in patients with heart failure. In these patients, the administration of synthetic triiodothyronine (T(3)) was well tolerated and induced significant improvement in cardiac function without increased heart rate and metabolic demand. Large multicenter, placebo-controlled prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the safety and prognostic effects of chronic treatment with TH replacement therapy in patients with heart failure. The article also discusses recent patents in this field.", "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and serum triiodothyronine (T3) in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).METHODS: 156 cases of CHF patients and 75 cases of cardiac function I patients hospitalized over the same period were utilized in this study. On admission, the patient's BNP and T3 plasma concentrations were measured. The correlation analysis of plasma BNP and T3 in CHF patients with cardiac function classification was conducted.RESULTS: According to the NYHA grading systems, the plasma BNP levels in patients with II, III, and IV grade CHF were significantly higher than those with cardiac function I (P < 0.05); BNP levels and NYHA grading of cardiac function correlated positively. The BNP concentrations increased with CHF progression (P < 0.01). The T3 level and NYHA grading of cardiac function correlated negatively.TheT3 level decreased as the degree of heart failure increased. Using CHF in combination with BNP to predict the occurrence of CHF had a sensitivity value of 90.8% with 95.5% specificity, 86.3% accuracy, and a negative predictive value of 87.7%.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BNP was more sensitive than T3 in the diagnosis of CHF. The T3 was more meaningful than the BNP in the prognosis of CHF. The BNP and T3 combination detection was more valuable in determining the severity of CHF and prognosis.", "Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism.", "BACKGROUND: Both low free triiodothyronine (fT3) and high brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) have been separately described as prognostic predictors for mortality in heart failure (HF). We investigated whether their prognostic value is independent.METHODS AND RESULTS: From January of 2001 to December of 2006, we prospectively evaluated 442 consecutive patients with systolic HF and no thyroid disease or treatment with drugs affecting thyroid function (age 65+/-12 years, mean +/- standard deviation, 75% were male, left ventricular ejection fraction 33% +/- 10%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and II: 63%, NYHA class III and IV: 37%). All patients underwent full clinical and echocardiographic evaluation and assessment of BNP and thyroid function. Both cardiac and all-cause mortality (cumulative) were considered as end points. During a median 36-month follow-up (range 1-86 months), 110 patients (24.8%) died, 64 (14.4%) of cardiac causes. Univariate Cox model predictors of all-cause mortality and cardiac death were age, body mass index, creatinine, hemoglobin, ejection fraction, NYHA class, BNP, fT3, and thyroxine level. Multivariate analysis selected age, NYHA class, hemoglobin, BNP, and fT3 as independent predictors for all-cause mortality and NYHA class, BNP, and fT3 as independent predictors for cardiac mortality. Patients with low fT3 and higher BNP showed the highest risk of all-cause and cardiac death (odds ratio 11.6, confidence interval, 5.8-22.9; odds ratio 13.8, confidence interval, 5.4-35.2, respectively, compared with patients with normal fT3 and low BNP).CONCLUSION: fT3 and BNP hold an independent and additive prognostic value in HF.", "Thyroid hormones have many effects on the heart and vascular system. Although cardiac output is reduced in hypothyroidism, heart failure is relatively rare because there is a lower demand for peripheral oxygen delivery. Hypothyroidism may also result in accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. We report the case of a 55-year-old man with severe heart failure associated with severe longstanding untreated hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain. On presentation, signs and symptoms of severe hypothyroidism and heart failure were noticed. The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and ischemia. Thyroid stimulating hormone was extremely elevated and thyroid hormone levels were undetectable. A cardiac ultrasonography exam revealed abnormalities of the left ventricular dimensions and function consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed severe multivessel disease. Coronary by-pass was deemed necessary, but surgery was postponed because of severe heart failure. After an increasingly downhill clinical course, the patient died, eight month after his initial presentation, owing to severe heart failure. This patient represents an example of an overlooked diagnosis of severe hypothyroidism, rarely encountered nowadays, leading to dramatic consequences.", "The derangement of neuro-endocrine control of circulation influences both disease evolution and response to treatment in patients with heart failure, but little data are available about the complex relationships between the degree of neuro-hormonal activation and clinical severity. We studied the relationships between cardiac natriuretic hormones (CNHs) and several neuro-hormones and immunological markers in a prospective cohort of 105 consecutive patients with cardiomyopathy (77 men and 28 women, mean age 66.7+/-12.4 years, range 33-89 years). We assayed the circulating levels of CNHs (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)), plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, thyroid hormones and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The concentrations of all CNHs and neurohormones were higher in patients with heart failure compared to normal subjects, except for free triiodothyronine (FT3), which was below normal values. ANP was positively related to NYHA class, IL-6, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, while negatively with ejection fraction and FT3. BNP was positively related to age, NYHA class, IL-6, TNF-alpha, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, while negatively with ejection fraction and FT3. A stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that plasma ANP depended only on ejection fraction, adrenaline and noradrenaline values, while for plasma BNP variation NYHA class contributed too. Our data confirm a progressive activation of hormonal and immunological systems in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, CNH circulating levels in heart failure are affected not only by cardiac function and disease severity, but also by activation of neuro-hormonal and stress-related cytokine systems, as well as by the thyroid hormones, even on usual medical treatment."]}
