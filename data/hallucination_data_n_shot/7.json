These findings suggest relative hypothyroidism in pathological hypertrophy, but serum levels of TH are usually normal. We studied the regulation of TH receptors (TRs) beta1, alpha1, and alpha2 in pathological and physiological rat cardiac hypertrophy models with hypothyroid- and hyperthyroid-like changes in the TH target genes, alpha- and beta-MyHC and SERCA. All 3 TR subtypes in myocytes were downregulated in 2 hypertrophy models with a hypothyroid-like mRNA phenotype, phenylephrine in culture and pressure overload in vivo. Myocyte TRbeta1 was upregulated in models with a hyperthyroid-like phenotype, TH (triiodothyronine, T3), in culture and exercise in vivo. In myocyte culture, TR overexpression, or excess T3, reversed the effects of phenylephrine on TH-responsive mRNAs and promoters. In addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, and TRalpha1 to alpha-MyHC transcription and increased myocyte size. We conclude that TR isoforms have distinct regulation and function in rat cardiac myocytes.

We investigated whether TR signaling and gene expression of MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the aged heart are affected by exercise training, using the hearts of sedentary young rats (4 mo old), sedentary aged rats (23 mo old), and trained aged rats (23 mo old, swimming training for 8 wk).
