Homozygous deletions and mutations of PTEN were observed in cell lines and sporadic cancers of the breast, kidney, and central nervous system. Germline mutations in PTEN were recently found in Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome, previously mapped to chromosome bands 10q22-23. This disease is associated with a wide variety of malignancies and hamartomas of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origin. The most common neoplasms in Cowden disease patients arise in the breast, skin, and thyroid (follicular subtype). To determine the involvement of PTEN in sporadic follicular thyroid tumors, we first analyzed sporadic follicular adenomas and carcinomas for deletions of the PTEN gene. Loss of heterozygosity was found in 7/26 (27%) follicular carcinomas and 2/27 (7%) follicular adenomas, one of which was a small hemizygous deletion (approximately 3 cm). Sequence analysis of the entire PTEN coding region revealed two mutations in carcinomas with 10q loss. Our findings suggest that the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is occasionally inactivated in sporadic follicular thyroid tumors.\\n- Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) are found in Cowden syndrome, which predisposes to hamartomas, breast cancer, trichilemmomas, and thyroid tumors of follicular epithelium. PTEN has also been found to be somatically deleted, mutated, and/or silenced in various sporadically occurring cancers such as glioblastoma, breast cancer, kidney cancer, malignant melanoma, and endometrial cancer. Loss or reduction of PTEN protein expression as well as inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization is seen in non-medullary thyroid cancers. However, although allelic loss of the PTEN locus in 10q23.3 is frequently seen, this is not coupled with mutations in the PTEN gene. To approach further the frequency and mechanism behind PTEN silencing, we screened a panel of 87 sporadic thyroid tumors for PTEN mRNA expression, including 14 anaplastic carcinomas, 37 follicular carcinomas, 21 atypical adenomas, and 15 ordinary adenomas. Complete loss of PTEN mRNA expression was evident in six of the tumors, including four anaplastic carcinomas, one widely invasive carcinoma, and one ordinary adenoma. The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. No association was observed between the expression, loss of heterozygosity, and mutation status in the 33 cases in which these parameters were compared. This indicates that PTEN silencing is a result of a wide variety of epigenetic and/or structural silencing mechanisms rather than a consequence of structural biallelic inactivation of the classical type. Furthermore, the high rate of alterations in the 10q23 region might indicate the presence of an as-yet unknown tumor-suppressor gene with an important role in the development of thyroid tumors.\\n- Various genes have been identified to play a role in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. Cowden syndrome is the only known familial syndrome with an increased risk of both follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) and carcinoma (FTC). Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. Although somatic intragenic mutations in PTEN, which maps to 10q23.3, are rarely found in follicular tumors, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers within 10q22-24 occurs in about 25%. Recently, another phosphatase gene, MINPP1, has been localized to 10q23.3. MINPP1 has the ability to remove 3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates, a function that overlaps that of PTEN. Because of this overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location of MINPP1 to a region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, we considered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could contribute to the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. We analyzed DNA from tumor and corresponding normal tissue from 23 patients with FA and 15 patients with FTC for LOH and mutations at the MINPP1 locus. LOH was identified in four malignant and three benign tumors. One of these FTCs with LOH was found to harbor a somatic c.122C > T or S41L mutation. We also found two germline sequence variants, c.809A > G (Q270R) and IVS3 + 34T > A. The c.809A > G variant was found in only one patient with FA but not in patients with FTC or normal controls. More interestingly, IVS3 + 34T > A was found in about 15% of FA cases and normal controls but not in patients with FTC. These results suggest a role for MINPP1 in the pathogenesis of at least a subset of malignant follicular thyroid tumors, and MINPP1 might act as a low penetrance predisposition allele for FTC.\\n- BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is seen in 3%-10% of individuals carrying a germline PTEN mutation. Patients with PTEN mutations are at risk for additional neoplasms as are their affected offspring. However, the frequency of PTEN mutations among DTC cases has not been systematically analyzed. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of PTEN mutations in an unselected group of patients with DTC and to identify whether additional clinical features might indicate the need for referral for genetic counseling and possible testing.METHODS: We collected personal medical and family history information, head circumference data, and blood from 259 consecutively identified clinic-based patients with DTC, unselected for personal or family history. Individuals were categorized for diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome (CS) using the 2009 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and underwent germline PTEN mutation analysis.RESULTS: Two of the 259 patients (0.8%), with both follicular thyroid carcinoma and macrocephaly, were found to carry a germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The PTEN mutation frequency in unselected cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma was 4.8%.CONCLUSION: The frequency of germline pathogenic PTEN mutations in an unselected series of patients with DTC is relatively low, but it is enriched by considering follicular histology and macrocephaly. These results suggest that by adding head circumference to the clinical assessment, thyroid cancer specialists can more effectively identify patients needing referral for cancer genetic services.\\n- Cowden syndrome (CS) or multiple hamartoma syndrome (MIM 158350) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for breast and thyroid carcinoma. The diagnosis of CS, as operationally defined by the International Cowden Consortium, is made when a patient, or family, has a combination of pathognomonic major and/or minor criteria. The CS gene has recently been identified as PTEN, which maps at 10q23.3 and encodes a dual specificity phosphatase. PTEN appears to function as a tumour suppressor in CS, with between 13-80% of CS families harbouring germline nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations predicted to disrupt normal PTEN function. To date, only a small number of tumour suppressor genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53, have been associated with familial breast or breast/ovarian cancer families. Given the involvement of PTEN in CS, we postulated that PTEN was a likely candidate to play a role in families with a \"CS-like\" phenotype, but not classical CS. To answer these questions, we gathered a series of patients from families who had features reminiscent of CS but did not meet the Consortium Criteria. Using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE), and sequence analysis, we screened 64 unrelated CS-like subjects for germline mutations in PTEN. A single male with follicular thyroid carcinoma from one of these 64 (2%) CS-like families harboured a germline point mutation, c.209T-->C. This mutation occurred at the last nucleotide of exon 3 and within a region homologous to the cytoskeletal proteins tensin and auxilin. We conclude that germline PTEN mutations play a relatively minor role in CS-like families. In addition, our data would suggest that, for the most part, the strict International Cowden Consortium operational diagnostic criteria for CS are quite robust and should remain in place.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nIs PTEN involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma?\\n\\nTask:\\n 1.
