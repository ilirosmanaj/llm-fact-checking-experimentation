The present study analyzes the role of T3 in reversing the depressant effect of excessive catecholamine stimulation in isolated porcine left ventricular myocardium.METHODS: Thirty-six left ventricular trabeculae (0.4 x 6.0 mm) obtained from 6 pigs were used for measurements of isometric force development, isotonic shortening, and intracellular calcium in three experimental series (measurement conditions: 37 degrees C; optimal length; supramaximal electrical stimulation, 1 Hz; calcium measurement, fura-2 ratio method; frequency, 225 Hz). In series 1, isometric force development was measured before and after a 60-minute incubation with 10(-7) mol/L epinephrine in preparations with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) preceding fura-2 loading for calcium measurements. In series 2, the acute effects of a 30-minute administration of T3 (10(-9) mol/L) on isometric force and intracellular calcium were analyzed (n = 6). In series 3, after simultaneous fura-2 loading and a 6-hour 10(-7) mol/L epinephrine exposure the effects of T3 (10(-9) mol/L, 30 minutes) on force development, shortening, and intracellular calcium transient were analyzed.RESULTS: Long-term and high-dose epinephrine exposure induced a severe contractile depression with a significant reduction of isometric force development (p < 0.05) and increased diastolic (p < 0.001) and systolic calcium (p < 0.001). In normal porcine myocardium T3 had no effect on the extent of isometric force generation but accelerated the time course of force development (p < 0.05) and increased the calcium transient (p < 0.001). After induction of myocardial depression by epinephrine exposure T3 accelerated the intracellular calcium transients and reduced diastolic calcium. Triiodothyronine increased the shortening amplitude and the force amplitude (p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Triiodothyronine reverses depressed contractile performance after preceding high-dose epinephrine exposure in isolated porcine myocardium. Increased force amplitudes and unaltered or even reduced intracellular calcium transients argue in favor of a resensitization of the contractile apparatus for calcium by T3. The study supports a potential role for T3 treatment in depressed myocardium after previous excessive catecholamine exposure (eg, brain death, catecholamine treatment, ischemia).\\n- 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is a novel endogenous relative of thyroid hormone, able to interact with trace amine-associated receptors, a class of plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors, and to produce a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect. In the isolated rat heart 20-25 microM T(1)AM decreased cardiac contractility, but oxygen consumption and glucose uptake were either unchanged or disproportionately high when compared to mechanical work. In adult rat cardiomyocytes acute exposure to 20 microM T(1)AM decreased the amplitude and duration of the calcium transient. In patch clamped cardiomyocytes sarcolemmal calcium current density was unchanged while current facilitation by membrane depolarization was abolished consistent with reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release. In addition, T(1)AM decreased transient outward current (I(to)) and I(K1) background current. SR studies involving 20 microM T(1)AM revealed a significant decrease in ryanodine binding due to reduced B(max), no significant change in the rate constant of calcium-induced calcium release, a significant increase in calcium leak measured under conditions promoting channel closure, and no effect on oxalate-supported calcium uptake. Based on these observations we conclude T(1)AM affects calcium and potassium homeostasis and suggest its negative inotropic action is due to a diminished pool of SR calcium as a result of increased diastolic leak through the ryanodine receptor, while increased action potential duration is accounted for by inhibition of I(to) and I(K1) currents.\\n- BACKGROUND: This study analyzes in the experimental model of isolated human atrial myocardium whether the myocardial contractile depression occurring after high-dose/long-term catecholamine exposure (as typically occurring in brain-dead organ donors) can be reversed by thyroid hormone administration.METHODS: Isolated trabeculae were prepared from atrial myocardium from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass (n = 15). Initial measurements of isometric force were carried out (measurement conditions of 37 degrees C, Krebs Henseleit solution, supramaximal electrical stimulation, 1 Hz, at optimal length). Then the trabeculae were incubated for 6 hours at 26 degrees C in a Krebs Henseleit solution containing epinephrine 10(-7) mol/L and the fluorescent dye FURA-2/AM for calcium measurements. At the end of the incubation period, isometric force, isotonic shortening, and intracellular calcium transient (FURA-2 \"ratio method\") were measured. After 30 minutes administration of triiodothyronine (5 x 10(-9) mol/L), the measurements were repeated. Control groups included 6 hours incubation in 4 degrees C Krebs Henseleit solution (n = 5); 6 hours incubation in 26 degrees C FURA-2/AM (n = 5); and 6 hours incubation in epinephrine 10(-7) mol/L (n = 5).RESULTS: After 6 hours catecholamine exposure isometric force declined significantly to 56.8% (p < .0001) and isotonic shortening to 54% of its initial value (p < .01). Administration of triiodothyronine was associated with a significant recovery of the isotonic shortening amplitude (p < .005), of isometric force development (p < .01), an increased velocity of force development (p < .0001), and of diastolic force decay (p < .005). At the same time the shape of the intracellular calcium transient became smaller as a result of an accelerated diastolic decay. The amplitude of the calcium transient remained unaltered, whereas the calcium time integral was reduced (p < .05).CONCLUSION: In the model of isolated human myocardium, experimental depression of the contractile performance resulting from long-term catecholamine exposure could be reversed by a 30-minute triiodothyronine incubation. The experimental data showing increased force amplitudes at unaltered amplitudes of the intracellular calcium transient and an even-reduced calcium time integral provide strong evidence for a sensitization of the contractile apparatus for calcium by triiodothyronine. The data provide additional knowledge to explain the successful administration of triiodothyronine in donor heart management.\\n- The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of thyroid hormone on tension development and the intracellular calcium transient in mammalian ventricular muscle. A hyperthyroid (H) state was induced in ferrets by subcutaneous injection of L-thyroxine, 0.3 mg/kg daily, for 2-3 weeks. One-half of the age matched control group (C) were injected with vehicle. Aequorin was loaded into the cells of ferret papillary muscles by a chemical procedure. The muscles were stimulated at 0.33 Hz and isometric tension and the calcium transient were simultaneously recorded at 30 degrees C. Peak isometric tension in mN/mm2 (+/- SD) was 15.4 +/- 7.2 and 16.2 +/- 7.9 for C (n = 8) and H (n = 9) respectively. The time to peak tension and time to 80% relaxation from peak of tension were reduced by 22% and 28% respectively in H compared to C. After stimulation, the calcium transient reached a maximum in 56 +/- 6 ms in C and in 47 +/- 5 ms in H. The time to 80% decay of the peak calcium transient was 95 +/- 8 ms and 68 +/- 5 ms for C and H respectively. The ratio of the aequorin luminescence at the peak of the calcium transient over the calculated maximum luminescence, Lmax, were compared and they were not different. At 22 degrees C Log (L/Lmax) was -3.3 +/- 0.1 in C (n = 4) and -3.4 +/- 0.3 in H (n = 3). These results indicate that the thyroid state influences the time course of the calcium transient and are consistent with the abbreviation in the duration of contraction that is observed in the hyperthyroid state.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nDoes thyroid hormone regulate calcium transient in the myocardium? \\n\\nTask:\\n 1.
