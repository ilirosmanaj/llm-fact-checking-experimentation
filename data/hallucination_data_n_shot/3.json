There are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents. Although some studies demonstrate a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, most studies agree that these changes are of minor impact, practically reflecting the relative negative energy balance during strenuous exercise. This state of hypometabolism during intense physical performance has also been confirmed in highly trained female young athletes, who may be also characterized by reproductive axis dysfunction, manifested either as luteal-phase deficiency or amenorrhea, alongside the typical constellation of low T3, insulin and leptin levels. More importantly, strenuous exercise during childhood or adolescence is mostly accompanied by a delay of skeletal maturation, and height and may have a long-lasting negative effect on growth and acquisition of maximum bone mass. In conclusion, although thyroid hormones are only transiently or insignificantly changed during strenuous exercise, adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes in order to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile. Moreover, when growth and pubertal progression in very young athletes are significantly impaired, a reduction in the intensity of the physical exercise should be advocated in order to guarantee better final height and adequate acquisition of bone mass.\\n- Significant increases in the concentration of plasma glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) and plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) concomitant with decreases in circulating levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and T3/T4 ratio were observed in homing pigeons, untrained for 3 months, after a flight of 48 km lasting 90-160 min. The increased level of FFA is attributed to glucagon stimulated lipolysis. The elevation of TG levels may be due to altered partitioning and utilization of lipoprotein in adipose tissue and muscle. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight.\\n- The purpose of the present study was to compare endocrine parameters reflecting reproductive function and metabolism in ten amenorrheic (AR) and eumenorrheic (ER) adolescent female runners and seven untrained controls (SE). Additionally, responses to diagnostic criteria for eating disorders (DSM-III) were compared among groups. AR ran more miles/day and consumed fewer kcal/d to support energy expenditure compared to ER (p < 0.05). Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. AR indicated they were very concerned about their weight and were fearful of gaining fat mass. Female adolescents who participate in strenuous training exhibit alterations in hormone levels reflecting reproductive function and metabolism.\\n- Serum lipids and thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days. Serum cholesterol was unchanged immediately after the race, but then fell significantly and remained low during the observation period. During the race the fatty acid composition of serum free fatty acids changed towards the composition of ordinary adipose tissue. The compostiion of serum triglycerides showed similar but less pronouced changes. On the following days an increase in the arachidonic, and a decrease in the linoleic acid fraction of the total serum lipids were observed. Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. The observations correspond to the findings during acute, severe illness, and are compatible with the hypothesis that some of the changes in serum lipids following severe somatic stress are due to increased thyroid hormone activity.\\n- Interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) activity is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and factors that influence thermogenesis appear to act centrally to modify the sympathetic outflow to IBAT. Cold exposure produces a rise in IBAT temperature as a result of the increase in sympathetic outflow to IBAT. This is associated with an increased thyroid activity. 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels increase during strenuous exercise, and, at the end of the exercise bout, a decrease of T3 and T4 levels, with an increase in TSH during the following 4-5 days, is seen. We evaluated the effect of strenuous exercise on 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity in IBAT in normal environmental conditions and after short (30 min) cold exposure. 5'-D activity is lower in rats at basal condition. Short cold exposure (SCE) increases 5'-D in IBAT both in exercising rats and in sedentary rats. However, this increase is lower in exercising animals. Strenuous exercise can reduce 5'-D activity in normal environmental conditions and after SCE. Probably, other compensatory mechanisms of heat production are active in exercising rodents.\\n- The effects of endurance training and season on the function of the anterior pituitary-thyroid axis were studied in 18 female runners and their 12 controls, and in 13 joggers and their 11 controls in Northern Finland, with a large seasonal difference in environmental factors. The serum concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) and oestradiol (E2) were measured during one menstrual cycle in the light training season (autumn) and in the hard training season (spring). The responses of TSH to intravenous TRH stimulation were also measured in the luteal phase of the cycle during the hard training season. Endurance running did not affect the basal or TRH-stimulated serum TSH concentrations, while those of T4 and fT4 in runners were lowered in both seasons and that of T3 in the light training season in relation to control subjects. The serum concentrations of TBG were also significantly lower in runners than their controls in the luteal phase in both seasons. The effect of jogging on thyroid hormones was less pronounced. Serum concentrations of TSH, T4, fT4, T3 and TBG were generally slightly higher in spring than in autumn. Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training. In spring the function of anterior pituitary-thyroid axis is more active than in autumn.\\n\\n(Optional) Few-Shot Demonstrations:\\nIf few-shot examples are provided here, they will look like this:\\n\\n[BEGIN FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n<Example 1 Input/Output Pair>\\n<Example 2 Input/Output Pair>\\n\u2026\\n[END FEW-SHOT-EXAMPLES]\\n\\nIf these examples are present, incorporate their style and approach into your solution.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nDoes strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?\\n\\nTask:\\n 1.
