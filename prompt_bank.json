Under no circumstances should you produce more or fewer boolean values than the number of provided triplets.\n\nSpecifically, you will:\n1. Consider the hallucinated_answer and the original answer.\n2. Identify hallucinated triplets among answer_triplets by determining which details appear in the hallucinated_answer but are not supported by the information in the original answer.\n3. Output two boolean lists—both having the exact same length as the answer_triplets list—where:\n• One boolean list includes comments explaining the reasoning for each corresponding triplet.\n• The other boolean list includes no comments.\nIn both lists:\n• false indicates the triplet is supported by the original answer (not hallucinated).\n• true indicates the triplet is hallucinated (introduces unsupported or fabricated details).\n4. There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the triplets and the boolean values in both lists. For example, if there are 4 triplets, you must produce exactly 4 boolean values in the commented list and exactly 4 boolean values in the plain list.\n5. Provide only the boolean lists (and optional comments for one version) unless the user requests additional details.\n\nFailure to match the exact number of boolean values to the number of answer_triplets means you have not followed the instructions correctly.

It is occasionally linked to IgM and may be influenced by environmental chemicals.'\n • Non-Hallucinated Triplets:\n\n[\n    ['Riedel thyroiditis', 'is', 'a rare form of thyroiditis'],\n    ['Riedel thyroiditis', 'is associated with', 'elevated levels of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)'],\n    ['histopathological analysis', 'typically reveals', 'IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration']\n]\n\n • Answer Triplets:\n\n[\n    ['Riedel thyroiditis', 'is', 'a rare form of thyroiditis'],\n    ['Riedel thyroiditis', 'is associated with', 'elevated levels of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)'],\n    ['Riedel thyroiditis', 'is occasionally associated with', 'IgM'],\n    ['Riedel thyroiditis', 'may be linked to', 'environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals']\n]\n\nThe LLM should output:\n\nBoolean List with Comments:\n\n[\n    false, // 'Riedel thyroiditis is a rare form of thyroiditis' is present in non-hallucinated triplets.\n    false, // 'Riedel thyroiditis is associated with elevated levels of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)' is supported.\n    true,  // 'Riedel thyroiditis is occasionally associated with IgM' is not present in non-hallucinated triplets.\n    true   // 'Riedel thyroiditis may be linked to environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals' is unsupported.\n]\n\nPlain Boolean List:\n\n[false, false, true, true]",

Hallucinated Answer (Source of potential hallucinations):\n{hallucinated_answer}\n 3. Answer Triplets (Extracted from the hallucinated answer):\n{answer_triplets}\n\nImportant: The number of boolean values you provide must match the number of triplets in answer_triplets. Do not produce any extra or fewer boolean values.\n\nTask:\n 1. Identify which of the answer_triplets are hallucinated by checking if the information in each triplet can be supported by the original answer.\n 2. Generate two boolean lists of the exact same length as answer_triplets:\n  • A boolean list with comments explaining why each triplet is or is not hallucinated.\n  • A plain boolean list without comments.\n\nEnsure both lists have the same number of boolean values as there are triplets.\n\nExample Output:\n 1. Boolean List with Comments:\n\n[\n    false, // 'Triplet 1 explanation...'\n    true,  // 'Triplet 2 explanation...'\n]\n\n2. Plain Boolean List:\n\n[false, true]\n\nIn this example, if there were exactly 2 triplets, we have provided exactly 2 boolean values for each list.\n\nNow analyze the provided inputs and generate the requested outputs, making sure the number of boolean values matches the number of answer_triplets exactly.",
